TypoDesc      "You cannot hold any more wolves in your hunter's bag." Lol. This seems to 
imply that I'm stuffing the entire animal into my bag, which I'm not. I'm 
just saving the skin. Would you consider changing that line to: "You 
cannot hold any more (animal) hides/pelts/skins in your hunter's bag."

"Your massive cloud of fire catches kyfaek on fire."
Which seems a little reptitive. Maybe change it to

Or "Your massive cloud of fire sends Kyfaek up in flames!"
