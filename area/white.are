Garden Path~
~
You walk on a small dirt path that winds through the now decaying garden.
Every couple of feet a dead branch or shrubbery blocks the path. The
garden is a deadly quiet. The birds no longer sing, and the crickets no
longer chirp. This is definitely not the same garden that Xiang Fung left
so long ago. The path continues to the west and south.
