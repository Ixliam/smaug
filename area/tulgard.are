seems to be always looking down, never raising his eyes.  He has a kind 
face, though.  Perhaps he might give you a hand if you asked?  <type heal>.

Common Room~

This common room is not as large as most, but then again the entire inn 
seems to be on the small side.  What it lacks in size, however, seems to be 
made up for in comfort.  There are padded chairs all around the tables, and 
all of the furnishings and decorations look quite expensive.  A finely 
polished wooden bar dominates the west wall, and a large brick fireplace is 
set in the east.  There is an exit back to the reception area to the north, 
and stairs leading up to the guest rooms.

Captured Devotion~

This building is spilling at the sides with used items and cheap and nasty 
bits and pieces.  Most of the items look as if they would barely survive 
being used once, before breaking.  This shop is obviously where people come 
to sell their unwanted belongings, but if you look close enough, you might 
find something useful.  There is a boldly painted sign hanging over the 
counter.

The Sunken Ship Tavern~
~
Rundown is definitely the word to use for this old place.  There are lots of 
tables and chairs around, but most are broken in some way, and quite dirty.  
A filthy wooden bar stands alongside the west wall, but there doesn't appear 
to be much to drink behind it.  Just a few old barrels, and seven swords in 
an odd shape, hanging from the wall. There are windows, but they are greasy 
and broken.  The exit to the street is south.

A Small River Port~
~
A moderately busy but small river port is bustling with activity here.  
Small to medium sized boats are busily navigating the river. Some laborers
can be seen hauling cargo off the boats into small warehouses along the city 
wall which lines the north and west right up to the water's edge.  
Several boats can be seen anchored along the wharfs here.

There are small stone buildings up ahead to the east and west.  A wide 
square is just to the south.  The city well is here for thirsty travellers 
and passersby, and is covered by an awning.

River Road~
~
You are standing on the north edge of a wide river.  It flows from west to 
east, and is fairly calm at this point.  You can see the land on the other 
side, but not well enough to make out any details.  You hear drunken shouts 
coming from the tavern to the north, and you see many boats and canoes 
docked just to the south of here.

a cleaning servant scream and run for cover. Along the walls empty shelves

There is an air of quiet in this small tidy room. A few bookcases, filled 
with tightly rolled scrolls have been placed against the walls. The walls 
have no ornamentation, and a single, thick candle stands at the centre of 
the room, bathing the room in a warm glow. Heavy curtains, drawn and held in 
place by a simple cord, frame the doorway that leads to the west.

As new as the city is, it looks like a guild of thieves has already 
organized and set up shop here hidden from the streets. The room is far from 
fancy - all you see is some excercise mats and a few tables and chairs. 
Maybe there is more than meets the eye. To the north you see what looks like
a small storeroom filled with crates and boxes.

Foreign-Made Furniture~
~
Inside this rather cramped and cluttered shop, are displays of furniture, 
some of which are quite unusual, and others which are more common.  The 
pieces of furniture haven't been made locally, but have been shipped in from 
distant parts of the land.  There are elven-made dressers, gnomish 
contraptions, and pieces of furniture large enough for a troll.

Karrusmon's Custom Creations~
~
As you enter the doorway, the aroma of exotic pipeweeds fill your head with 
thier heavy scents.  There are about a dozen little beakers and bottles with 
some concoction or another boiling away in them, heated from some unseen 
magiks.  The interior of this shop is impecibly clean and organized.  There 
are many shelves behind the main desk which are very neatly lined with 
countless spell components, empty bottles, and blank sheets of paper.  
Hanging on the walls there are some weapons that emit strange vibrations 
into the air.
