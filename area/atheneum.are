-------------------------------------------

NOTE: All OOC chat has been edited out.

For your reading pleasure, the recording has been cut into three segments. Please READ P1, P2, or P3.


~
E
p1~
Part 1

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'First off, I would like to thank everyone who participated for making this an amazing debut Amaranthine Tournament. I would also like to give some credit where it's due. This event was originally created and organized by Rene. Shea helped create the scramble list, the area used in Capture the Flag, and was one of our monitors checking for rule breakers. Agridelious also helped out with the monitoring! Sinjin gave good ideas, including the logistics of the Capture the Flag game. Lastly, give a shout-out to Vladaar and the rest of the team for making everything possible!'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Now, for the sake of those who missed parts of the event, let's look back on some of the good times.'

 Fireworks burst into the air, forming twin dragons and interweaving vines, eventually turning into the words "ETERNAL, UNDYING, EVERLASTING".

 An image forms in the clouds to depict Xire proudly holding an amaranthine egg,  while the ancient green dragon looms behind him.

 The clouds shift to show Xire and the other Forbidden City dragons running towards a crystalline amaranthine baton hovering in midair.

 The mirage of an enormous leatherbound book appears in the sky, its countless pages flipping to reveal the story of Tanzean'al's betrayal. The book shuts and the cover is revealed to read "Story Quiz".

 The sky turns a reddish orange as the sun ends its journey.

 Suddenly, the clouds form a maze and you see a faint image superimposed. The image shows Althalos and Syrin running through the labyrinth towards a winged cat.

 As the previous image dissolves, a new one shows combatants from various parts of Alternis locked in combat in the arena.

~
E
p2~
Part 2

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'That was just the first half! The second half got even more exciting, not to mention confusing-'

 The clouds part to form a frame, which contains a picture of the three cities at their respective taverns, feasting on desserts and drinks while chatting with one another.

 The picture changes to show Xire standing in the middle of Tanzean'al's manor, victoriously holding a flag, with all of Forbidden standing around him.

 Scrambled words suddenly float across the sky, threatening to give you a headache with their complexity. Eventually, they sort themselves out and fade off into the distance. An image of Syrin with a smug grin shows up briefly before fading out.

 All of a sudden, you see what must be an illusion of Rene dashing across the sky with countless people on her heels, and Syrin running ahead of her for some odd reason. Sytos manages to catch her by the shawl though, and the illusion disappears.

 The frame in the clouds turn dark as bright words appear. "SCENES FROM AWARDS CEREMONY GO HERE," they read.

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'I hope you all enjoyed the Amaranthine Tournament and I hope this Tourney will be a legacy as everlasting as its namesake. However, the First Amaranthine Tourney has not yet ended! After all, we haven't announced the winners yet!'

&c A large, majestic scroll reads:

&WWelcome to the Paleon Atheneum! Here, you will find writings and artefacts from around the world.

To read a book, simply explore the Archives until you come across a book with a letter number combination, such as AC5. To look at that book's cover, just LOOK AC5 (or whatever the combo of the book is). To read it, just LOOK AC5-page number. To read page 1, LOOK AC5-1. To read page 2, LOOK AC5-2. 

Here is a key to what the letters of a book combination stand for:

PW= Places of the World
BE= Beastiary
FT= Fiction
AC= Ancient and Current History
FP= Famous People
PT= Professions of the Time
FD= Food
MT= Mathematics
AS= Astrology

Our example book, AC5, would be a book in the Ancient and Current History archive. To see a list of books we currently own and their corresponding codes, please LOOK BLIST.

Due to many patrons forgetting to return material, you are no longer allowed to borrow books. As such, the books have been enchanted so you cannot pick them up. Just stay in the room and read the book (it does not have to be in your inventory for you to read it). 

Finally- We have lost many books over the course of the years due to vermin, war, and impolite patrons. If you have a book you would like to submit, or plan on writing either a reference book or an autobiography, please speak with our current curator, Rene. &D

&wNo one thought much about the plain little girl growing up in Jarynth. My family was never wealthy, nor impoverished, and I had a pleasant if uneventful childhood. No one paid much attention to me, who had an average appearance and no special talents to speak of. When I turned sixteen, however, everything changed.

Her parents wanted to marry me off to a merchant's son. Despite my protests, my father would not take no for an answer. My stubborn childhood self decided to rather eat worms than marry that snooty man, and thus snuck out of my home one dark, stormy night. I had, in my young foolishness, only a handful of coins with me. 

I ran through endless roads and forests, until one day I ran out of food with no civilization in sight. Pursued by an orc, I fled deep into the woods and passed out at the base of a large tree. When I awoke, I was in Loramoor, being tended to by the elven healers.

&w
After that day, I lived with them, eating their bread and drinking their clean river water. They taught me the use of herbs and how to create poultices. They taught me spells, magic, and the history of the world. From their patient words, I learned about places I could never have imagined. Suddenly, a provincial farm girl became an herbalist.

Eventually, I left Loramoor. The city, while beautiful, was the city of elves and I, no matter how much I study their ways, will never be an elf. I decided to travel to the large city to the southwest- Paleon, which I had heard so much of from the elves. 

In Paleon, I lived in a room above the tavern and made friends with the old tavernkeeper. I spent my days buried in the books of the Atheneum, learning the apothecary's craft. In my small inn room, I began to learn to brew potions using the herbs I gathered around Loramoor. Eventually, I was able to open my own shop near the city center, and that's where I have lived and worked ever since. 

Since then, the old tavernkeeper has passed away and Loramoor has grown quieter and quieter. It is no use thinking so much of the past, though. I am proud to help young adventurers grow and keep going forward.

&CArctic changelings, which dwell in the Ice Caverns far to the north, have long been a source of confusion. These creatures were revealed to be human warriors with the ability to shapeshift to appear as stalagmites, icicles, snow, and blizzards. How they are able to shapeshift has yet to be explained, but here is what we do know of them and their behavior.&D 

&cTo read on, LOOK BE1-2&D
~

be1-2~
&CAppearance: A small pile of snow
Behavior: Very aggressive, enjoys snowballs both as playthings and as weapons. Quite weak in comparison to the other changelings.

Appearance: An icicle
Behavior: Appears to have truesight, but is thankfully peaceful. Also weak, but uses icicle missiles to attack. While the shower of ice may deter young adventurers, it's not extremely effective.

Appearance: A solid blue icicle
Behavior: Unlike its close relative- the common icicle, it does not have truesight, but is stronger physically. It also uses icicle missiles, and is extremely rare to find. 

Appearance: A stalagmite
Behavior: Placid and silent, almost indistinguishable from actual stalagmite formations. Uses its jagged points to spear during battle. Decently powerful.

&cTo read on, LOOK BE1-3&D
~

be1-3~
&CAppearance: A swirling blizzard
Behavior: Despite its chaotic appearance, it does not go out of its way to attack adventurers. However, it is a good bit stronger than the usual pile of snow or icicle, using its gusts to slam into its opponents.

Appearance: A large pond of solid ice
Behavior: Do not let its still appearance fool you. Though it will not attack on sight, it is a formidable opponent should you provoke it. It is able to pull adventurers through cracks in its surface and into its icy depths, and is one of the most powerful arctic changelings.

Appearance: A massive stalagmite
Behavior: Also known as a greater arctic changeling, this non-aggressive changeling is stronger than all others. Like the smaller, common stalagmite, it will spear victims on its sharp spikes when provoked. Only two exist, lording over the rest of the changelings.

&w&i     We never knew. We never knew someone could keep something so painful inside and not reveal it for so long. Even long afterwards, we didn't know he needed our help. All we did was watch and return to our own lives. Even though he might have been scared for himself, we never knew. 

     There's a story I have to tell, so the world after us will know what courage is. Without knowing it, this story of such humble beginnings became something larger than all of us because we couldn't stop it. We couldn't save him.

&w     "Ceiros, there must be some news." Running a hand through his brown hair, Kyrie Aliston leaned forward to peer at the man sitting across from him in the lobby. Ceiros Virnas, the grey-haired Provost of the Sirenis University, gave a heavy sigh. 

     "It has been almost a year, Kyrie. I am not sure, at this point, Leanna is still alive," the Provost replied quietly, looking at Kyrie's slumped figure with concern. "The scouts are still out searching at Antiom's request, but I cannot trouble the Captain for so long." 

     Kyrie nodded. He thanked Ceiros and stood up from the couch. Looking around the quiet lobby of the University, he took in the sparse decor and cold stone architecture. How long has he taught here without the halls feeling impersonal and forbidding? Back when Leanna was still... He shook his head, gathering his papers and thoughts at once. 

     "You should get going to your class, unless you want to take the day off? I am sure Julian can take over for just a day, as forgetful as that young man can be," Ceiros commented, taking in Kyrie's pale countenance. The professor shook his head and gave a wan smile. 

     "I will be fine, today's lecture is a quick one. If I feel too tired, I will let Julian talk," he reassured the Provost, who nodded carefully, still frowning. "Do not worry too much, Ceiros, you might get even more wrinkles than you already have."

     Behind his pince-nez, Ceiros narrowed his eyes at the jibe but gave a chuckle. "Here I thought I was keeping my youthful appearance up quite well, too."

     The two old friends said farewell to each other and departed their respective ways. &D

&w     Julian tucked his hair back impatiently as he flipped through yet another Analysis of Ancient Beldarian Texts essay. Reaching out blindly for his hot cocoa, he murmured thanks when Kyrie handed the mug to him. 

     "Mera's essays are getting better. She's going more in depth with the content instead of just tossing ideas together in a mishmash," the assistant remarked, making a few notes on the essay with his quill.

     Kyrie chuckled into his coffee mug. "Was that not your main issue, back when you were my student?" He grinned at the young man over his stack of papers.

     Julian still looked the same now as back in his student days- silver hair still tied in a cheerful ponytail, blue eyes still holding that bright curiosity, build still as skinny as ever. The only difference was the glasses perched on his nose. Shaking his head amusedly, Kyrie looked back down at his own reflection in the coffee.

     He has not changed much himself. Grey eyes are more tired more often now, but the face is still the same. Still quite youthful, he dared say. His hands were more callused now, though. He looked at them thoughtfully, eyes drawn to the silver wedding band. Feeling Julian's gaze on him, he tore his attention off the band. 

     "I heard from Zora that Captain Antiom is going to call off the search for Leanna," Julian said softly, lowering his eyes to stare into his mug. 

     "Right, Zora joined the guard," Kyrie remininsced to himself, "He was a good writer. Liked sparring more, though."

     Julian's grip tightened on the mug. "Is this it, then? Are they giving up on finding her? Are you?" He suddenly realized his grip and let go as if burned. "I am sorry, I just- I thought maybe there was still hope."

     Kyrie leaned back in his chair and sipped his coffee. He looked out the window at the dark night sky. "Who knows? I do not know what more we can do. We have had scouts out looking for a year already. They have searched up to the desert in the west and Irenyis's crystal forest in the north."

&w     "What if she is in Irenyis? Or Beldar, &ibeyond&D&w the desert?"

     "You know our guards are not allowed in those citystates," Kyrie replied, shooting Julian a stern look. "I will not have more animosity directed towards Sirenis on our account. If she is in Beldar, we have no hope left anyway. A Sirenian in Beldar is good as dead."

     Julian slumped dejectedly. Kyrie sighed, reflexively running his fingers over his wedding band. 

     "I will move on."

     "You have said that," Julian murmured, knitting his brows together, "months ago."

     Silence stretched uncomfortably for a few minutes. Kyrie cleared his throat, gesturing at the papers.

     "You should catch some sleep. I can finish these myself." The professor retrieved Julian's stack of papers and put them on top of his own. Julian looked at him, frowning. After a moment, he stood up and got his cloak from the hanger. 

     "Thank you for the cocoa. Sleep well, Kyrie," he replied, nodding respectively on his way out. 

     Kyrie watched the door shut and gave another sigh. He doubted he would get much sleep. Insomnia was becoming a well-known acquaintance.

The Paleon Atheneum, a magnificent building, is situated on this street. 
Made out of bricks, the Atheneum houses a plethora of knowledge and 
information gathered through the ages by many scholars and sages. Two 
marble lions, facing each other, stand on the steps leading up to the 
atheneum. There is an inscription carved on top of the entrance leading

rocky floor here. Sharp stalactites hang from the ceiling, looking like 
they could drop at any moment. There is an etching on one of the slabs of 
rock wall.

An Overgrown Field~
~
Grass grows in wild spurts in the field, emerging as many scattered 
clumps. Tiny rodents dash through the tangled grass at intervals, all too 
fast to be caught. A large anthill lies in the middle of the field, with 
minuscule ants poking their heads out from it. A bird gently sweeps past 
overhead in the sky, cawing as it does so.

A Well in the Field~

A large cobblestone well sits in the field, with a wooden bucket by its

The overgrown field suddenly recedes into a well-kept meadow. Once left to

Twin rows of bookcases fill the room, with tomes and books neatly arranged 
on them. There is a small metal plate on the end of each bookcase, listing 
down the books available. Above the bookcases are heads of various beasts 
and animals, mounted on plaques affixed to the walls. A small archway 
leads out to the east into the corridors of the Atheneum.

Paleon citizens walk among the rows of bookcases, flipping through the 
books to look up the extraordinary beasts of the land. At times, they even 
look up from the text they were reading and gesticulate wildly at the 
heads mounted on the wall. Amongst the numerous craniums mounted in the 
room, there is a small blue head that looks out of place with the rest of 
them.

There is a pine table here in the Archives, stretching from the entrance 
to the far side of the room. On the southern side of the room, there are 
scroll racks hanging on the walls, with the name of the scrolls engraved 
below them. Hanging on the north wall is a huge tapestry, depicting a map

There is a map of the city of Paleon unrolled on this part of the pine 
table. It seems that an inconsiderate patron of the Atheneum forgot to 
return it to its proper place on the scroll rack. There is a black smudge 
on the lower right corner of the tapestry, almost marring the great work 
of cartography. There are more scroll racks in this room, holding more 
information about the world.

There are mounds of dust in the archives, over the bookcases, tables, and 
even the chairs. Apparently, not many people visit this section of the 
archives, or bother to clean up the place. The bookcases are surprisingly 
filled to the brim with yellowed books and musty tomes, each looking like 
they could crumble apart at the slightest touch. There is a dust-covered 
plating on the bookcases. A small archway leads out to the east into the 
corridors of the Atheneum.

Dust covers almost everything in the back section of the archives. It 
seems clear that no one has come into this place for a long time. Perhaps 
the history of the world was deemed too boring. There are bookcases placed 
here, once standing proud in the past, but now covered with dark grey 
streaks of dust, the books almost invisible behind them.

This part of the Atheneum archives is rather popular among the youths of 
Paleon. Those youths that can read usually browse the archives to read 
more about exciting vocations and their requirements, whereas others just 
stare in awe at the glass cases. As such, the bookcases here house a lot 
of tattered and dogeared books.

Almost everyone of note is mentioned within the Paleon archives, with a 
short biography dedicated to them. Sometimes, even the famous would submit 
an autobiography to the librarian of the Archives, so that they can be 
remembered for all time. Paleon citizens at times idly browse through the 
bookcases, looking up the history of these distinguished people, while the 
more enterprising ones sit at the table writing their own biography, 
hoping to get it approved by the librarian and hence be forever in the 
Archives.

This room has countless paintings of scenes ranging from romantic 
portraits to battles set in a world unknown. A number of soft armchairs 
and couches form a circle in the middle of the room. Along the walls, 
bookshelves have been filled with small bound books of fiction. A crescent 
shaped table in the center of the room surrounds a single pillar of 
magical light. Motes of light floating around the ceiling provide more 
light for reading.
