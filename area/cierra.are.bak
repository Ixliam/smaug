The Hills of Perinthia~
~
Gazing over the lucious, green hillside, you find yourself in awe of the
stately view of trees growing thickly along these foothills.  Tall evergreen
trees stand at perfect attention upon the hill, creating a beautiful sea
of emerald green with their thick blanket of branches.  The light scent of
pine kisses the air with fragrance, adding the light, airy aroma of a crisp
spring morning.  Gentle melodies of happy birds singing their first songs
of spring are carried by a warm breeze which brushes your cheek with the
welcoming warmth of a newly rising sun.  A large boulder fits snuggly against
the hillside to the west.

Forested Glade of Perinthia~
~
Climbing up the hillside, your ears are filled with the songs of several
spring sparrows which perch high within the branches of the trees here.  The
warmth of the sun is a pleasant welcome to you, shining its gentle rays of
light down upon all the creatures of these jade-colored foothills of Mount
Cierra, which stands with purple majesty within the horizon of Perinthia.
Gracefully sloping upwards, the earth here is rich with plant life, providing
a feast of shrubs and other bushes for the deer that roam through the forest.
Fragrant blossoms of lilac and other wild flowers fill the air with the sweet
scent of springtime.

Climbing the Foothills~
~
The crisp scent of pine floats on the breeze, bringing a fragrant aroma of
cleanliness unto the forest as it winds thickly up the foothills of Mount
Cierra.  Dark, rich soil allows the plant life to grow with luster, giving
the blossoms of lilacs a rich color of purple.  Overhead, a hawk circles
lazily above you in the morning sun as it searches the ground below for its
first meal of the day, while a doe chews peacefully on some plump, red berries
that it plucked from one of the many bushes that grow all along the sloping
hillside.  As the morning sun shines its rays of light down on you, a light
breeze brushes through the forest.

The Path Within the Glade~
~
Sweet melodies of happy birds singing fill your ears with the sounds of
spring as it places its gentle touch upon the hillside.  Colorful blankets
of wildflowers blossom with shades of reds and blue along the ground, giving
this foothill the magical, painted look of a serene portrait displayed in the
castles of kings and queens.  As the crisp, morning air fills your lungs with
freshness, two butterflies dance upon fluttering wings over the wildflowers,
while a mischievous raccoon scurries between two thick bushes growing along
the pathway that you walk on.

Further Up the Hillside~
~
Golden rays of sunlight warm the morning air, giving a cheery brightness
to this hillside.  A forested glade of gigantic trees climb up this foot-
hill, covering its base with an emerald-green blanket of foliage rolling
as far as the eye can see up the mountainside.  Birds chirp happily in the
forest, singing their songs of spring time as the scent of colorful wild
flowers lift your spirits.  A playful raccoon, digging through the bushes
for a quick snack of juicy, red, berries, rustles through the underbrush.

Warmth of Sunshine~
~
A cool breeze blows past your face, planting a gentle kiss upon your cheek
as it flows along this hillside.  As you climb the hill, the incline gradually
increases, making your legs a bit weary as they move across the thick blanket
of grass and wildflowers that plushly covers this foothill.  Warming rays
of sunlight color the sky, painting it with a shade of golden yellow as it
shines down upon you.  The magic of spring is upon the mountain further ahead,
coloring your path with brilliant greens and blues, making this hike up the
foothill a rather pleasant one.

Base of Mount Cierra~
~
No longer upon any luxurious foothill, you find yourself standing at the
base of Mount Cierra.  With graceful lines stretching upward as far as the
eye can see, this mountain stands with purple majestically in horizon of 
Perinthia.  Eagles soar through the golden skies that tower over the peaks,
gazing down upon the world with their stately presence that's much larger
than any man-made creation.  At night, the silvery starlight unfolds across
the mountain top, and twinkle magically upon all creatures that live here
undisturbed by any human visitors that may attempt their accent to the snow-
covered peaks.  A large boulder bares the scrawlings of a mountain man who
was contemplating the beauty of Mount Cierra.

Rocky Trail of Golden Skies~
~
A small path leads away from the foothills which adorn the base of Mount
Cierra.  Winding partially up the mountain, the trail is lined with large,
stately trees towering far above you while their branches reach gloriously
toward the golden skies where a lone eagle soars among the billowing clouds
of white.  The sun shines brightly here, illuminating the area with golden
rays of warmth and life while birds tend to their nests perched high up in
the trees.

Along the Rocky Trail~
~
Large boulders, fallen from Cierra's mountainside, lay strewn across the
trail that winds up through the forest.  Flowers, bright with the colors
of spring, grow in thick blankets of blues and pinks near the rocky path,
brightening Cierra's majectic appearance.  With careful steps across the
pebble-covered trail, a petite doe wanders through the trees, nibbling
gently upon the foliage that graces the terrain while butterflies fly
coordinated dances through the air.

Boulders Aplenty~
~
Following the trail, you find yourself surrounded by several of the
large boulders that have fallen from the mighty lofts of Cierra, and
tumbled down the mountainside before coming to their final resting place
here, before the forest near the base of the mountain.  Moss grows thickly
along these boulders, giving them the appearance of large, dull chunks of
jade resting undesturbed within their earthen settings of the forest.  A
raccoon, perched upon one of the boulders, watches you intently as you gaze
onward to the path before you.

Climbing Up the Slope~
~
Further up the mountainside, any visible signs of a path have all but
disappeared, leaving you with no trail to follow up the rocky slopes of
this monsterous mountain.  The tall redwoods, which grow so thickly and
abundantly at lower altitudes, seem to be thinning out now, and few of the
enormous boulders make their final resting place here.  Though some greenery
still grows this high up on Cierra, the hillsides here are relatively bare of
plants and creatures except for the occasional mountain goat munching on the
grass or a hungry bear scavenging the area for any type of food it may find.

Forgotten Paths~
~
The mountain's slope grows steeper here, causing you to have to occaisionally
bend over and grasp at the grounds to keep from falling over backwards.  Any
sure-footing that you had before has been hindered by the unsavory incline
that leads to Cierra's snow-covered peaks.  Few, if any, people climb this
far up the mountain, leaving the countryside undisturbed by anything other
than the sparse number of creatures that venture this dangerously high.

Miners Delight~
~
Tucked high upon the slopes of Mount Cierra, a large plateau of rock juts
up from the ground, and peeks out over the slopes of the mountain.  The bold,
stoney face of the plateau glares down upon you, staring at you with wide eyes
of rocky boulders, giving the mountain an ominous look as you travel along her
majestic mountainside.  Glittery flakes of silver and gold twinkle in the
sunlight.  Strange hammering noises can be heard from somewhere around here,
though you're unsure of the source.  Struggling to keep your footing on the
ground of loose pebbles, you reach out to a boulder which rests against the
base of the plateau.

Cooler Heights of Mount Cierra~
~
The air grows cooler at these heights upon the mountain, making you shiver
slightly in the breeze that blows from Cierra's snowy peaks.  A few trees
still grow this high, though no forests grow on the top of the mountains,
leaving little vegitation, if any, at the peaks.  The ground here is covered
with pebbles, making your climb a rather difficult one.  With the difficult
terrain and lack of animals, no hunters ever venture to the dizzy heights
which you have achieved, though stories of monks living in a monastery tucked
within the peak leave you to hope that if you find yourself in danger, someone
may come to aid you.

Sparce Trees and Snowy Mountaintop~
~
Traveling further up the mountain, you find a thin blanket of snow on the
ground.  The air is thin here, making breathing a little difficult as you
climb along the upper regions of Mount Cierra.  Few trees grow this high on
Cierra, and few creatures venture from the safety of the forest which now lays
several feet below you in a plush, green blanket of scenery.  A set of small
tracks lead further up the mountain.

Cierra's Snowy Mountain Tops~
~
A thin blanket of snow covers the area, giving everything a magical sense
of serenity away from the noises of the forest or the busy way of life in
the towns that lie in the shadows of Mount Cierra.  Few creatures can survive
at these dizzy heights because of the lack of warmth, though an occasional
winter sprite can be seen touching the leaves of the sparce vegitation with
its magical wand of frost.  The breezes blow cold winds against your face,
leaving your cheeks with a rosey pinkness.

Haven of the Yeti~
~
A cold wind blows through the mountainside, carrying with it a strange,
pungent odor.  Large tracks travel their way through the blanket of snow
which covers the higher elevations of Mount Cierra.  The few trees which do
grow here provide ample shelter for whatever has made those tracks.  A strange
wailing noise can be heard from within the trees, reminding you of tales heard
in Perinthia of a yeti which roams wild among the mountaintops of Cierra.
Brushing those stories aside, though, you travel onward.

The Footprint of a Sasquatch~
~
Large footprints criss-cross their way across the snow, which now lies in
a thick blanket of whiteness upon the mountaintops here.  A heavy, pungent
odor fills the air, causing your stomach to churn sickly.  The mountains seem
to kiss the sky, sending it's peaks brushing proudly through the clouds as they
reach for the warming rays of the sun.  Wandering through the trees, the
footprints disappear into the distance, though a heavy wail can be heard as
the sound of a yeti's fleeing travels send the soft sounds of crushing snow
through the thin air.

Snowy Tracks of a Mountain Top~
~
Cooling winds blow loose snow from the mountainside into your face, chilling
your cheeks with the wintery blast of cold air as it swooshes across Cierra's
snow-covered peaks.  Large tracks, too over-sized to be a man's, wander off
through the snow, disappearing in the distance.  A few pine trees stand alone
in the snow with snowdrifts climbing their way up the tree's knotty trucks
to encase them with a heavy, wet blanket of whitness.  Few, if any, people
have ever managed to climb to these heights except for monks that reside
further up the mountain in a peaceful monastery.

Snowy Peaks of the Mountain~
~
Several inches of snow crunch beneath your feet, making your path a rather
slippery one as you climb your way up the mountain.  Cold, wintery winds
blow loose snow along the ground, wiping out your footprints and making it
difficult to determine which way you come from.  The snow here is slushy with
moisture from a fissure that blows steam from Cierra's deepest core, releasing
the heat from hot springs which boil far beneath the surface.  This warmer
temperature heats the packed snow, sending a steady river of water tumbling
down the mountainside.  The fissure blocks your passage any further east.

Steam-Filled Fissure~
~
A small flow of melted snow drips from the fissure as it flows gently down
Mount Cierra with a peaceful sense of serenity.  Warm from the steam in the
fissure takes the chill from the air in this small area, allowing your teeth
to stop chattering for a moment.  Cold, blowing winds still manage to blow
over the fissure, though, carrying the moistened heat into the air, making
a tuft of fluffy whiteness into the sky like a cloud.

Edge of a Steamy Fissure~

Steam from the fissure billows high into the sky, creating a large white
cloud above the fissure.  The snow here has been melted and frozen repeatedly,
creating a slippery pathway of dangerous ice around the rim of the fissure.
Pale, ice blue skies hang peacefully over the mountain, providing a beautiful
backdrop of serenity over Mount Cierra.

Path of the Holy~
~
A patch of drier land winds up the mountainside, carving through the snow as
it leads up the mountainside to a small monastery tucked high in the peaks
of Mount Cierra.  Few visitors ever travel this far, leaving the monastery
relatively undisturbed by the evil influences of the society that resides all
around the base of the mountain.

Path to the Monastery~
~
The blanket of snow that covers Mount Cierra glistens with whitness, offset-
ting the drier paths that lead to the monastery.  Few people of Perinthia
venture up the mountain, leaving the monastery untouched by the evils of
society which thrives in the towns at the base of the glorious mountainside.
The trek has been difficult, causing your feet to ache as your weary legs
unwillingly carry you further up the hill.

Rise of the Holy Ones~
~
Climbing Cierra's mountain peaks, you release a sigh of relief as you finally
reach the bottom of a set of stoney steps, carved by monks, that lead to a
peaceful monastery perched high upon the mountain.  Melted snow has refrozen
here, making the steps slippery and dangerous.  Holy men climb these stairs
daily, clearing away fresh patches of snow that have formed overnight, to
make the travel a bit safer for any lost soul who wishes to join their sacred
order of religion.

Climbing up the steps has proven to be difficult, causing your chest to
heave with every breath as you travel up the mountain.  The monastery lies
in sight now, gracing your vision with a gentle reprieve of modest color
as the soothing shades of brown walls peek out from beneath a white rooftop
of wintery snow.

Before the Monastery~

A pair of wooden doors stand closed, blocking the wintery winds of Mount
Cierra's snowy peaks from entering the warm sanctum of the monastery.  All
snow has been cleared away from the doorstep, providing you with the safety
of sure footing as you raise your hands, reddened by the chilling air, to
knock on the door.

The Holy Sanctum~
~
Stepping inside the monastery, your feet begin to thaw as the heat within
the room wraps its comforting arms around you.  Balding monks, dressed in
robes of worship, sit on the floor here, praying that the goddess of the
mountain will send her blessings of wisdom and strength upon them.  Few
sounds are ever spoken here except during mass, when the rejoicing voices of
the monks can be heard echoing through the monastery with their chants of
worship.

Silent corridors, tucked away from the sanctum, lead through the monastery,
providing passage for the monks to their quiet dormatories.  Few words are

way to a large redwood forest lining the mountain's perimeter.  Large,
majestic trees reach for the sky, kissing the fluffy whiteness of the clouds
with a thick canopy of foliage.  The air is warm here, carrying the scent of
spring time through the mountains as the golden rays of a beautiful morning
shine down upon every creature of the mountain.  Thick shrubbery and other
bushes grow wild here with their colorful red and green berries adding a
splash of color to your surroundings.

branches reach through the clouds to embrace the warming rays of the
sun.  Darting between the trees, a pair of rabits zig-zag across the
terrain and flee from some unseen persuitor while the branches of the
foliage in the forest shake with their passing.  A throaty growl from
somewhere within the trees resonates with the sound of the rabbits' 
defeated hunter, as the rabbits disappear within the foliage.

the trees here, warming the bases of the redwoods when the wintery clouds
shed their snow down upon the mountain while the boulders, fallen from high
peaks of Cierra, block the waters from carrying the soil away when the rains
of springtime cry their happy tears of new life onto the mountain.

The current is strong now as it pushes you furiously downstream, leaving
you with little hope that you're going to survive this trip while you cling
desperately to a fallen redwood branch.  Thankfully, smoother waters do lay

more of the runoff of melted snow gathers here, the river becomes wider,

miracle will happen so save your tired body for flailing uncontrollably

around to make sure that no miner is near.  Hearing the sounds of a mine cart
rolling down the tracks and toward you, you think better of it and move on.

Small, wooden tracks for a mine cart run throughout the tunnel, as miners
deposit their gold and silver nuggets within the carts to transport them to
the entrance of the tunnels.  Along the stoney walls of the tunnel, veins of
silver and gold glitter in the glowing light of torches that line each passage.
Curving into small passageways throughout the mountains, these tunnels have
produced enough gold for a king to bathe his royal subjects with wealth,
though somehow, little of that wealth has been shared with the miners.  Still,
day after day, they continue their work with the hopes that the owner of this
mine will someday share his wealth with them.

Veins of Silver~
~
Sparkling veins of silver shimmer with the luminous light of the torches in
the walls of this tunnel, giving the tunnel the appearance that small stars
are encased in the darkened heavens of stoney mountainside.  A pair of wooden
mine cart tracks run the length of the tunnels, able to carry the silvery
nuggets to the entrance of the mine.  Here, miners hammer at the walls of the
tunnels with their pickaxes to retrieve the precious metals buried deep in the
heart of the Cierra Mountains.

End of a Tunnel~
~
Following the wooden tracks through the mine, you seem to find yourself at
the end of the silver tunnel.  Here, few flakes of silver sparkle in the
walls, making it not worthy of the miners' time to pick at the walls to
retrieve the silver.  Lit torches still line the wall, though, as miners
take their breaks from digging and rest in this quiet room while they have
their lunch.

Mother Lode of Gold~
~
Wide veins of gold flow through the rock like rivers of yellow lava cutting
their way through the land.  Shimmering nuggets, the size of your fist, are
carelessly strewn about the room as the miners dig through the walls of one
of Mount Cierra's mining tunnels.  A pair of wooden tracks run along the floor
of this tunnel while one of the fully-loaded mine carts rolls past you on its
way to the entrance of the tunnel.

Gaping Shaft~
~
Following the tunnels through the mines, you find yourself standing above
a gaping shaft that plunges deep into Mount Cierra's mountainsides.  Freshly
dug by miners in their endless search for more gold and silver, this shaft
is used by the miners to lower lanterns to the lower levels of the tunnels,
providing light for the excavators as they dig carefully through the mines.
Though a rope dangles over the edge for miners to grip as they begin their
descent into the newly carved tunnels, several miners and excavators have
fallen to their death.

Descending into the darkened shaft, your torch illuminates the hairlike
veins of silver that cut through the stoney walls in a shimmering flow of
shiny metal.  The empty shaft echoes with the sound of your feet struggling
against the walls of the tunnel as you carefully climb down into the never-
ending darkness that lies within the mountains.  Careful to keep your grip
tightly around the rope, you inch your way down the shaft, hoping that you'll
soon reach the bottom.

The Heart of Cierra~
~
Finally making it to the bottom of the shaft, you double-check your torch
to make sure it will last long enough for you to look around.  The tunnels
here are dark, leaving only this room illuminated with your torch.  Several
thousands of years ago, lava flowed angrily through the heart of Cierra as it
pushed its way to the surface, carrying with it the burning rage of destruction
and total devistatiton.  The volcano within the mountain lies dormant now, only
spitting a fine column of steam from small fissures at the upper-most edge of
a lava crater which now forms Cierra's many peaks.

A Freshly-Dug Tunnel~
~
Jagged walls of rugged stone line the tunnels throughout Cierra, which is
riddled with tunnels and passages carved by water and flowing rivers of lava
from deep within the mountain's core so many years ago.  Thick, shiny veins
of gold and silver, which cut so perfectly through the rock above, are much
thinner now, making mining this deep almost pointless.  Enough of the precious
metal remains, though, urging the mine owner to work his miners harder than
before to dig up the priceless minerals.

Freshly Carved Tunnel~
~
The dark tunnel curves within the mountain, making it difficult to see
what lies ahead as you travel within the heart of this once raging inferno
of lava and flowing fire.  Walls of solid rock encase the tunnels, wrapping
them in a stoney tomb of shimmering rock lined with thin veins of glistening
silver and gold.  The floors are rough, lacking the smooth surface of a neatly
polished stone like in some of the other tunnels above.  Stepping carefully
through the pebbles, you hold your torch in front of you to lighten your path.

Unfinished Tunnel~
~
Deep within the heart of the mountain, Cierra's tunnels wind in a maze-like
pattern through rocks and other minerals.  Once filled with molten lava,
these tunnels now provide miners with silver and gold to extract from the
mountain.  Though the veins of gold and silver are very thin, there's still
enough wealth buried within Cierra to drive the miners to carve new tunnels
with their pickaxes.  Lacking the man-power to dig very quickly, though, some
of the tunnels lie unfinished until firther excavations can be done.

The tunnel curves through the darkness, winding within the heart of the
mountain with echoes of times in the past when lava flowed freely through
these passages.  Now, miners excavate the rock making each passage wide
enough for even the largest of humans to move freely within the tunnels in
their search for gold and silver.  Your torch barely illuminates the room
around you, making the glistening flecks of silver reflect weakly with the
light of precious metal.

Freshly-Dug Tunnel~

The rough tunnels of the miners curve through the mountains, and join
with the smooth surfaced natural tunnel.  Lava once flowed vengefully
through these caverns, melting the stone with raging rivers of heat and
fire.  Though these passages are cool as you travel through the darkness,
you find yourself a little uneasy, nonetheless, with the knowlege that
you're so deep within the once-heated bowels of Cierra.  Gripping your
torch a little tighter, you move onward, though, hoping to find a few
nuggets of your own to recover.

Smoothly carved tunnels wind through the mountain, leading you through the

fire.  Few veins of silver and gold line the walls here any more, making the
further excavation of the tunnels unworthy of any more effort.  Gone are the
glistening walls of shimmering metals, only to be replaced with a strange,
crystaline stones which reflect the light from your torch with a dull shine

The tunnels open up into a larger cavern filled with small, white stones
that blanket the floor like a thick shroud of snow.  Larger stones peek up
from the white floor and appear to be like small, creatures playing on a 
fresh field of powdery, glistening field of magic, while other stones,
perfectly smooth and round, lie in neat little piles on the floor like tiny
snowballs.  Stalagmites rise from the floor like trees, towering over the
rest of the area.

Glistening white stone fills the cavern, giving the area the appearance
of a magical land of wonder.  Delicate stalagmites reach up from the floor
and tower above the white stone like trees.  Smaller rocks formations lay at
the base of the stalagmites, and resemble children dancing around a snow-
covered Christmas tree, while a smaller, more smoothly surfaced area of the
cavern lies in the center of this cave, like a frozen pond that has been kissed
with the wand of a winter sprite, forever freezing it in stone.  Magical
formations of chrystaline flowers line the edges of the room like the fresh
blossoms of spring.

El Capitan of Redwoods~
~
Gazing high into the sky, you find it impossible to see the upper
limbs of the tallest tree within the forest.  A great number of stories
have been told about 'El Capitan' throughout the years, giving this tree
a personality of its own.  With its lofty branches perched among the clouds,
this redwood provides a sense of safety to the birds as they make their
nexts each spring within the limbs.  Though noone has ever been able to
climb to the top of this mighty tree, several of Perinthia's young males
each boast of climbing higher than anyone else ever has before.

Climbing about halfway to the first set of branches, your arms have already
become sore with the weariness associated with strenuous effort.  The thick,
knotless trunk of El Capitan makes it difficult for you to get your footing
up as you climb up the tallest tree in the forest.  As you struggle with every
inch of the tree, a gentle squirrel swishes its tail as it scurries up the
trunk.

The Heart of El Capitan~
~
You finally made it to the first branch in the tree. It's easily as wide as 
one of the streets in Perinthia, though much more dangerous to walk upon.
Squirrels scurry here, flicking their tails with a warning that someone has
entered their tree, making it no longer safe for the creatures here.  Though
much of the tree still towers above this spot, most of the climbers make it
no further than this and easily succumb to dizziness, making their ascent a
rather dangerous one.

~
Moving precariously away from the trunk of the tree, you find yourself
standing upon a rather thick limb of this redwood.  Thick foliage of El
Capitan grows plushly from this limb wrapping the upper portion of the
tree with a jade-colored coat of branches and leaves.  The sound of an
eagle's cry pierces the still air.

the nest, creating a soft bed for the eagle to lay her eggs upon.  Cool winds
blow through the tree, shaking the leaves of El Capitan's branches gently,
while fluffy tufts of clouds move through the canopy of this mighty redwood.

Further up the tree, you find yourself rather high above the ground.  Most
of the area below seems insignificantly small, and are dwarfed by the large

the many branches that extend from the trunk of this redwood, which make you
unsure of how thick many of the limbs truly are.

branches of El Capitan.  Thick limbs criss-cross each other here, providing
you with a very steady place to rest your feet.  Here, few birds fly as the
fluffy whiteness of the clouds brush through the treetop, sometimes making it
impossible to see the branches that reach up unto the sun.  Cool breezes blow,
carrying the crispy air from the snow-covered peaks of the mountain.

Climbing to the top of El Capitan, you wrap your arms around the thickness
of its trunk as you gaze down at the lands below.  The thick, canopy of foliage
blankets the area below you, hiding parts of the river of melted snow that runs
gracefully down the mountain.  In the distance, the rooftops of the homes and
shops of Perinthia seem nothing more than the rooftops of several dollhouses
covering the ground below.  Here, the air is cooler than down on the ground
as the cool breeze from Cierra's snow-covered peaks blow unobstructed by
other trees that grow in the forest.  At night, the skies above El Capitan
twinkle with magic, as the lacey stars of the heavens unfold their delicate
lights to the citizens of the world.

clear, allowing you to see the two, water-filled tunnels that branch off
in different directions at the bottom of this pool of water.  Though your

rock outcroppings hang from the ceiling and into the water like large walls
made of impenetrable steel, making your passage through the tunnel a difficult,
if not dangerous.  Swimming in the darkness of the rock tunnel, small, cave
lizards brush past you on their quick ascent from their next somewhere deeper

The waters of this narrow tunnel seem surprisingly warm compared to the
other tunnels of this cavern, leading you to believe that you must be near

Here, thousands of years of guano is layered thickly on the stone, making it
rather difficult to scale the sides of the once-living rock as you struggle
