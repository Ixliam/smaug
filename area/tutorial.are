A wild bobcat is growling here.

This wild bobcat looks quite fierce, growling and hissing at everything 
around it, despite its small size. It's about three feet tall and covered 
in dark spots and small stripes. Tufted slightly, its ears perk up at any 
slight sound. Its emerald eyes regard you with suspicion and fear.

Librarian Fysklor~
A very old Librarian is standing here.

A heavy tome in one hand, Fykslor the Librarian looks distracted from your 
presence by the book. A pair of golden spectacles perch precariously on 
the edge of his nose and squinting violet eyes peer out from behind them. 
His white hair has been messily slicked back, though a few errant strands 
still hang annoyingly in his face. His wizened form seems to be swallowed 
by the voluminous gold hemmed lavender robes he wears.

A worried looking city manager is sitting at a desk with lots of papers on it.
~
Pheltias' tired grey eyes regard the stack of papers on his desk with 
distaste. Paleon's city manager looks to be of middle age, though his red 
hair is already showing a few strands of pale yellow and white. He wears 
the white and gold robes of Paleon officials, with a cheerful yellow 
cravat contrasting with his weary complexion. His freckled hands sign 
papers and stamp registrations with deftness that comes only with years of 
doing the same task over and over.

Guild Master Baeralm~
A tall man dressed in finery clothing is sitting behind a desk here.
~
The guild master sits behind the counter, cast in resplendent robes of 
ivory and gold. He peers at the bucket of coal and pickaxes next to the 
counter with disinterest, checking the inventory now and then. His tall 
form is lean and pale, and green eyes set into an angular face stare out 
owlishly from behind black bangs. The hem of his robes are slightly 
dirtied by soot, but other than that, seem abnormally pristine for all the 
crafting debris lying around.

Shopkeeper William Estrella~
A human shopkeeper is tending his wares here.

Old and crotchety, William Estrella is not a pleasant individual in the 
least. Adorned with homemade armor that looks more akin to a trash can, 
than to armor, he waddles around the shop making minor adjustments to how 
the armor is arranged.

Of average height, Lorax has a rough complexion and a stocky build. His 
green eyes appraise his wares with a critical glance, polishing the 
weapons now and then with precise motions. His silent nature is reflected

A muscular human male is displaying his wares here.

Vaekon may be short for a human, but he makes up for it with his strong 
build. He handles the armor in his shop with deft strength and constantly 
polishes their gleaming surfaces with a rag stored in his apron. His short 
cropped hair is a rich brown, slicked back slightly from the sweat on his 
forehead. With an easy smile, he greets customers with laidback
