For your reading pleasure, the recording has been cut into three segments. Please READ P1, P2, or P3.

p1~
Part 1

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'First off, I would like to thank everyone who participated for making this an amazing debut Amaranthine Tournament. I would also like to give some credit where it's due. This event was originally created and organized by Rene. Shea helped create the scramble list, the area used in Capture the Flag, and was one of our monitors checking for rule breakers. Agridelious also helped out with the monitoring! Sinjin gave good ideas, including the logistics of the Capture the Flag game. Lastly, give a shout-out to Vladaar and the rest of the team for making everything possible!'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Now, for the sake of those who missed parts of the event, let's look back on some of the good times.'

 Fireworks burst into the air, forming twin dragons and interweaving vines, eventually turning into the words "ETERNAL, UNDYING, EVERLASTING".

 An image forms in the clouds to depict Xire proudly holding an amaranthine egg,  while the ancient green dragon looms behind him.

 The clouds shift to show Xire and the other Forbidden City dragons running towards a crystalline amaranthine baton hovering in midair.

 The mirage of an enormous leatherbound book appears in the sky, its countless pages flipping to reveal the story of Tanzean'al's betrayal. The book shuts and the cover is revealed to read "Story Quiz".

 The sky turns a reddish orange as the sun ends its journey.

 Suddenly, the clouds form a maze and you see a faint image superimposed. The image shows Althalos and Syrin running through the labyrinth towards a winged cat.

 As the previous image dissolves, a new one shows combatants from various parts of Alternis locked in combat in the arena.

~
E
p2~
Part 2

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'That was just the first half! The second half got even more exciting, not to mention confusing-'

 The clouds part to form a frame, which contains a picture of the three cities at their respective taverns, feasting on desserts and drinks while chatting with one another.

 The picture changes to show Xire standing in the middle of Tanzean'al's manor, victoriously holding a flag, with all of Forbidden standing around him.

 Scrambled words suddenly float across the sky, threatening to give you a headache with their complexity. Eventually, they sort themselves out and fade off into the distance. An image of Syrin with a smug grin shows up briefly before fading out.

 All of a sudden, you see what must be an illusion of Rene dashing across the sky with countless people on her heels, and Syrin running ahead of her for some odd reason. Sytos manages to catch her by the shawl though, and the illusion disappears.

 The frame in the clouds turn dark as bright words appear. "SCENES FROM AWARDS CEREMONY GO HERE," they read.

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'I hope you all enjoyed the Amaranthine Tournament and I hope this Tourney will be a legacy as everlasting as its namesake. However, the First Amaranthine Tourney has not yet ended! After all, we haven't announced the winners yet!'
~
E
p3~
Part 3

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'And now, what you've allll been waiting for- AWARDS. Drumroll please!'

 [Icc] Colje 'bangs on his snare'

 [Icc] Syrin stamps his feet the floor.

 [Icc] Sytos drums on her belly.

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'The winner of Most Epic Roleplay goes to Zaiden of Dakar, for repeatedly great showings in in-person roleplay.'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Funniest RP goes to...'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'SYTOS, of Forbidden! For an idea of her RP, check our her bio!'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'And now. the FINAL AWARD.'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'The WINNING CITY of the First Amaranthine Tournament of Alternis goes to...'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'FORBIDDEN CITIES. Dragons, may your roars echo through the lands for your grand victory!'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Uh.'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Forbidden City, not Cities.'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Forbidden won this with 12 points, with Paleon coming in second at 7 points. Dakar had 3 points, though not for lack of effort.'

 [Event] Ruri, the winged cat 'Now then, everyone please meet congregate at the centers of your respective cities. Food will be appearing soon for the ceremonial feast! Cheers for a good end to the First Amaranthine Tournament.'
