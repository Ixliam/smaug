&O                             'WARNING!'

    Beyond these woods is said to lie a fearsome groupd of beasties and monsters.
Beware of being out alone at night. Only the strong may live to tell the tale. Many
have ventured into these woods but few have returned to tell the tale.

                             'BEWARE!'

Hidden Nook~

This nook was made for hiding. The lush green bushes in front block view

cover the ground in what appears to be a soft bed. The wind blows through 
this section just right keeping it cool in the summer and the hanging

Clearing in the Forest~
~
This place is nearly empty of natural environmental factors. Such as rock 
formations or leaves or twigs. This area seems to be kept in perfect 
condition by the multitudes of goblins bowing at the outer edge of the 
circle. As any leaves fall from the trees, one of the attendants reaches 
up and snatches it and promptly eats it just to keep the sacred ground 
bare.

The Armory~

The light is extremely bright here and the light beneath your feet seems 
incredibly solid as if the sun from this dimension strengthened it. The 
wind whistles through the air warm and light as if it were singing a song.

Within the Dojo~

The ground here seems to be slightly more stable as if someone were 
expecting disaster or hard hits. The air feels as if it's charged as if 
from a recent burst of lightning. There are many young dragons here 
training and focusing their individual skills in the martial arts and 
mental preperation.
