of light can be seen making it obvious that the entrance to the caves is 
that way. To the north east and north west the massive caves lead deeper

A Crossing of Paths~

This cave leads off in many directions. One path leads to the southwest 
another to the east, and yet another to the north east. Large pieces of 
wood seem to be placed all around the walls in places making the caves 
look as though they were mines at one time.

There are three paths leading through the massive network of caves that is 
Fox Den. One path leads to the north, and another to the north west that 
seem almost identical with the amount of pillars and support beams in the 
walls, however to the southeast a small amount of natural light can be 
seen reflecting off the cave walls.

Inside Fox Den~
~
&OSmall amounts of dust and debris cover the floor of the cave, a lot of 
it moved, especially where there has been a lot of traffic over the years. 
Sounds of foxes and other cave living creatures can be heard echoing 
through the caves giving them a lively sound.

Inside Fox Den~

To the north a huge cavern opens into the famous "Moonless Hall". From 
here, in the distance a very large door can be seen far to the north. Old 
wooden support beams and other mining equipment can be seen laying along 
the floors, abandoned.
