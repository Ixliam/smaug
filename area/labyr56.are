~
Rough stone walls rise up to either side, the tunnel runs west and
east.  The walls of the tunnel are of grey stone, shot through with
alternating streaks of snowy white quarts, and night dark obsidian.  The
floor underfoot is covered with a thick layer of dust, small stones litter
the dusty surface.  The tunnels are dark, no breath of air stirs the dust
underfoot.  To the south an iron bound door lies open.
