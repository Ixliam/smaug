The Questing Quail~
a newly created first mob~
The Questing Quail pecks at the ground here.
~
Towering over you is a giant quail. It's feathers are as hard as steel and they clink
and clank when the great beast moves. Hollow, black eyes are set forward in this bird's
skull, implying that it was created to be a predator. Razor sharp talons adorn this
creature's feet, and you can see thumb-like talons protruding from its wing-tips.
Blood stains this nightmare's beak, as it opens it to roar in defiance at you!

You are standing in an immense cavern deep inside the earth. The smell of fresh
blood and dirt permeate the air here. Trophies and medals are seen strewn about
the floor of this terribly unorganized living space. A desk sits in the far
corner, covered in a layer of dust from centuries of neglect. An arcane workstation
is glowing with an eerie light. A sizable hole is seen in the heighest part of the wall
to the south, letting the light of the sun filter in and illuminate this dreadful place.
