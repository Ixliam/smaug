The Plains~

You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way. However you
are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
enter the hills far away north.

A short distance to the west the walls of the great city of Paleon can be seen
acting as a barrier to the city.  The flatted out pathway to the north leads
off deep into the dense forest.  The forest along the roadway to the east has
been trimmed back to discourage bandits and wild animals from making prey of
travellers that are passing by.

Much reluctance plagues your thoughts as you stumble onto the old bridge 
leading south into the Black Forest, in which there is rumored to be an 
ancient mountain, within which lies a labyrinth of untold riches. None
who have ever gone looking for the treasure, though, have returned
to verify the rumors (or perhaps chose for some reason to be silent).

In a Thick Forest~
~
Looking back, the sanctuary of New Paleon City seems to beckon you now more
than ever before. The woods to the south project feelings of despair and
misery. The bards used to tell you stories of horror about mighty
adventurers who would traverse into the heart of the Black Forest, never
to return. And who knows how long the old, rusted bridge to the north
will hold out? Better to not take that chance, perhaps.

Even the breeze flowing through the treetops is dark and gloomy. Strange

The distance to the bottom of this hole is much more than anyone in their

to carry even slightly-heavy souls down into the depths of the underbelly.
Probably not the wisest thing to test its might, though. Also, a weathered

the old ladder's rungs. A vile stench seems to emanate from below, causing

An ice-cold breeze flows through the room. The stench of unavoidable death
fills the frigid air with an immense aura of despair. The blackened walls,
ceiling and floor look infinite from this point-of-view. Torches made from
bones of some sort line the sides of the room, though none are lit.

Within the Black Forest~
~
Even the breeze flowing through the treetops is dark and gloomy. Strange
noises come at you from each direction. The leaves on the ground might make
rustling sounds if they were not soaked down with blood. In each direction,
the forest seems to grow darker and darker.

Gazing Upon Mount Doom~
~
The forest is abruptly left in the distance. Gazing up, the mountain peers
down upon you like a vulture carefully monitoring its prey. Though this
place looks quite serene from the outside, the stories and tales about Mount
Doom have discredited that notion of serenity long before now.

A Long, Cavernous Tunnel~
~
Though cold and dreary-looking from the outside, the temperature within the
mountain is relatively comfortable. The tunnel appears to stretch for some
distance southward, though traversing too far into this accursed place does
not look to be a very wise decision.

Green Winter Ale Brewery~
~
Ahh, the good ol' Green Winter Ale Brewery. This is the place in which all
of Jack's "magic" begins (and, fortunately, ends). The dust that covers most
of the floor would suggest that Jack has not needed to brew any fresh Green
Ale in quite some time. Maybe the shelf lives of the existing bottles is
just very long. Probably not, though.

The puddles have now become a single, massive pool enveloping the floor
of the tunnel. To the south, strange, chant-like noises beckon investigation
in that direction. The journey now has become one of survival, not only
a search for riches. The labyrinth depicted in tales of olde must be close,
though in which direction is totally unclear.

At this point in the tunnel, tiny cracks have become evident in the lower

strange thing is that all of the water from the floor of the tunnel seems to
be gravitating towards the cracks. From the south, the chant-like noises
have become louder.

Each and every piece of this particular tunnel seems to have been built with
the skulls of different creatures- those creatures that foolishly traversed
into the Circle of Doom. Though no torches appear in sight, a soft, though

A massive, crumbling granite throne sits darkly in the middle of the dirt-
covered floor, casting visions of terror upon the four walls. The room's

lives in this place must not be too warm itself.

This shabby, threadbare room appears to serve the purpose of housing those
individuals who have consumed a bit too much of Jack's green winter ale and
are quite unable to make the journey home on the same night. A messy double
bed- the only piece of furniture in the room- rests in the middle of the
floor and looks as though it has not been made up nor laundered in quite
some time.

be too precarious to enable you to make it back down.
