A Clearing~
~
Tall grass bends and sways in the warm, moist breeze fresh off the ocean. 
A sense of foreboding fills the area. Tufts of grass blow around when the 
wind picks up over a breeze. Cries of various animals can be heard in the 
distance. A small pool looks inviting. Animals silently enter and leave, 
drinking at their leisure.

Light breezes swirl and blow, lending this sandy shore a hint of serenity. 
Water lapping at the sand, hypnotizing in its ebb and flow. Tiny shells

Gouges line this part of the trail. Various tree limbs look to be 
scattered haphazardly. The trees lining this path have some strange 
markings in their bark. Tiny circular markings touching almost the bottom 
of them. Shadows crossing the trail blend into the grass, leaving a sense 
of deep, dark foreboding.

Trees shroud this part of the cove. Shade abounds, keeping one from the

occasionally if one watches the water long enough.

Rocks litter the area before the sea here. Gulls land and soar, their 
cries ever present. Monkeys peek out through the trees. On the side of one 
boulder a prominent claw print can be seen. Is this the fabled place of

Less and less of the path can be seen. a sense of overwhelming fear 
permeates the area. Nary a sound can be heard, almost as if the island was 
protecting itself. A dark opening can be seen off to the east, the path 
leading right towards it.

A Calm Shoreline~
~
Light breezes swirl and blow, lending this sandy shore a hint of serenity. 
Water lapping at the sand, hypnotizing in its ebb and flow. Tiny shells 
lay scattered along the shore until the next high tide. Small footprints 
head away from the water.

A Small Depression~
~
A small haven from the nastiness that is the cavern makes one wish to 
stay. There is no dust, a mat rests invitingly alongside one wall. A small 
pool for one to drink from waits calmly.
