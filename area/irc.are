IRC vs Mud part 1~
~
Most people who start playing via IRC find the game quite hard at first
due to some major differences than IRC.  The first one is communicating. 
Here you cant just type what you want to say.  The reason for this is there
is so much more than just talking here.  Type `#`YWho`^ now and you will
see who is currently logged on to the game.  The people who appear on that
list are located anywhere in the 5300+ rooms the game currently contains.  
The rooms you are currently in are new... and will be extended with more 
info on the differences of IRC vs MUD when we get time.  To continue at this
stage type `#`Yrecall`^ and follow the instructions there.

Starting out~
~
You have just moved north into another room in the game.  We are in the 
process of writing a set of rooms within Dawn like these which act as a 
school on mudding - commonly called a mud school...  At this stage the 'mud 
school' has not be completed but will cover all the basics of playing the 
game.  `1 `1 You do however have a newbie guide book in your possession, this book has 
10 short chapters which has the information you need to get on your feet 
quickly.  `1`1It is `Wstrongly`x advised that you read the newbie guide book now if you arent 
familar with dawn, at least peek at the first page of it which shows you the 
chapters...  To do this type `Ylook guide`x.  `1`1 Once you have finished any reading you wish to perform, type `Yrecall`x to be 
transported into the game.  `1`1Happy mudding,`1`1- Kalahn.
