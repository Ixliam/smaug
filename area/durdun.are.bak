There is a heavily reinforced guard post along the trail here. The trail 
leads north to a small village. There is a thick forest on either sides of 
the trail. A small wooden gate that is broken hangs from the hinges.

is apparently named after a local hero . To the north, there is a statue

The ringing of metal gets louder as you approach a large building with 
black smoke pouring out of the chimney. The man inside the building to the 
north is beating a hammer on a red-hot chunk of metal. Another man to the 
south is making what appears to be metal armor. There is yet a third man 
to the west, who seems to be the local blacksmith.

swords, axes, lances, and many other kinds of weapons around the small forge.

The Durdun Smith~
~
This forge is cooler, but the smith is still as massive. There are many 
broken and damaged items laying about, and, though there are many orders 
and he must be very busy, he grunts an affirmation when he hears the door 
open. However, he stays bent over his work.

littered with debris it's impassable. The keep stands tall to the north.

In fact, there are no kind of decoration anywhere. There are stairs 
leading up. A staircase leads down, as well. The stones are smoothed from 
constant travel, and there are bloated and ruptured corpses everywhere.

if was hit with an axe. Once inside, the constable is well-deserving of 
the title, as there are many heads of vicious animals mounted on the 
walls. Wanted posters with large red X's also litter the walls, apparently 
caught criminals.

glowing red-hot with sizzling human remains piled inside. There is a lone 
door to the east.
