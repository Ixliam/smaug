Possessed Priest~
Possessed priest~
A priest wanders around in a daze
~
A darkness emanates from the former priest.  His eyes glow a bright
red to the point that even in the darkest room you would see them.  His
skin has paled from its original color to one that allows you to almost
see the bones within.

Possessed priestess~
A priestess wanders in a daze
~
This lady's former body has lost almost all shape from the lack of
nourishment.  The hair that was once well groomed is half missing
and very dirty.  Her skin has paled to the point of looking almost
like it was not even there.

Braxcis the devil~
A horned devil stands before you
~
A shadow that looks just like the shadow lord that was just slain. His
face changes as a little time goes on to a shapeless void.  His body
changes as well and turns to look just as a black mass of nothing.  Then
reshape's itself into a demon looking being.  Horns, claws, and hooves 
begin to take shape upon the being.  In a short amount of time a set 
of wings begin to grow from the back of this thing.  In no time a very
dangerous looking devil type being stands where once a shadow of lord
Iufn was.

Opening into the mausoleum ~
~
Looming a short way in the distance stands a rather impressive looking
structure that looks made entirely of marble.  Carvings cover the entirety 
of this building.  Most of these carvings appear to be very intricate in
design as well as use.  Some of the carvings surrounding the entry way seem
to tell a story.  The story seems to be surrounding a guy imprisoning multiple
rather powerful looking demons within a building.

The foyer of this building is rather void of any kind of furniture and
decoration.  There are more carvings upon the floors, wall and ceiling

to be telling a story.  In this carvings the man seen before has the 
demons in a subdued type of posture upon what one would surmise to be
the floor.  More carvings surround those which appear to be glowing.

seen in the entrance of this building.

Descending souls~
~
Special carvings are embedded into the ground in this room.  Two of
the carvings are reminiscent of once again carvings of the powerful
demons seen in the entrace of the mausoleum.  They seem to be signs
of some type.  Moaning is readily heard coming from both up, and down.

Mausoleum library ~
~
This entire room seems to be devoted to nothing but books.  On each
and every wall, and somehow even on the ceiling books line gigantic book
shelves.  Carvings also appear in this room as the ones previously.  All
the runes in this room appear to be glowing a bright white color.

blood and gore~
~
The sight in this room is almost enough to make even the most battle
hardened adventure turn pale.  Blood, bones, assorted body parts litter
the entire floor of this room.  The gore is more then ankle deep in
the middle of the floor.  Small lights of red can be seen as the carvings
in this room try their hardest to shine even in the most hideous of places.

Black marks, and chunks missing out of the walls in this room are 
plainly seen all over the place.  Even chunks missing out of the 
floor do not go unnoticed.  The carvings in this room do not seem
to be glowing at all.  Seemingly as if the explosions in this room
weakened the carvings into nonexistence.

The floor in this room appears to have been blasted apart.  Desks and

some blood stains can be found in the very center of the floor where
the blast seems to have originated. The carvings in this room seem to
have been destroyed in the explosion.

be seen.  The light in the room is enough to almost blind anyone.  A
strange heat emanates from within this room. The carvings in this
room are glowing a VERY bright white.

Clerical chambers~

In the back of the room pushed up against the wall sits several rather
nice looking desks.  In the middle of the room and coming up to the
front of the room is a rather lot of cots.  The cots do not look like
anyone has slept in them in a few long time.  The desks all seem to
be well piled with many different types of parchment   The carvings
appear to be glowing fainter then seen in previous rooms.

Piles of bones, and blood stains litter the whole of this floor.  Even
the carvings which are trying to hard to glow are glowing a bright red
color because of the blood.  What looks like finger nail scratches are
seen embedded into the very marble of the floor in this room.  A pit
is seen in the middle of the room leading down.  The finger nail marks
lead straight into this pit.

within the room.  The carvings in this room are also trying vainly to

This room is easily noticed to have at one time to have been a class
of some type.  With all the destruction and gore that surrounds the
room itself it is very hard to have any clue what type of class would
have been held in this now sorry sight of a room.  The glyphs in this
room seem to not have any glow at all.

rooms around this section of the mausoleum.  However, the corpses in
this room just as the one to the side of it appear to have died with no
reason.  No marks, no blood nothing.  Carvings in this room as with the
one to the side glow a bright white color.

in this room look as though they have never been touched by anything.

bodies lying in the middle of the room in piles.  Half rotted corpses and
a few that appear to be fairly fresh are mingled together in this room.  The
carvings in this room appear to be slightly glowing.  A horrendous smell
comes in from the door to the north.

~
Many hooks hang down from the ceiling in this room.  A few of the hooks
have what looks to be bodies hanging from them. Upon closer examination 
however one finds that the bodies are in fact multiple parts of different
bodies being sewn together slowly.  One of the bodies appears to be almost 
alive as it is examined.  On the floor many arms, and legs as well as
other body parts are seen.

Bright hallway~
~
This hallway unlike the rooms before is strangely void of anything
at all.  The only thing that can be seen is a rather large amount of
carvings that litter the entire four walls.  These carvings are 
similar to the ones seen on the entrance of the mausoleum.  These  
depict the one humanoid controling the other demons.  However, in 
this one it shows the demons each being given a special type of what
looks like a gem.  In another set of carvings it shows the gems being
side by side, and finally in yet another carvings it shows them almost
as if being placed together.

of wrought iron bars does not however show anything on the other side of
