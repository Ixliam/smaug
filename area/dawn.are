a huge grinning troll~
A huge grinning troll is here.
~
Nothing quite inspires fear in the majority of the inhabitants of the land 
the way a troll does, and it's easy to see why.  He has great, yellowed 
teeth and a heavily muscled body, which would be enough to inspire fear 
into the average man, but, in addition, his eyes bear a wicked, intense 
gleam.  He looks to enjoy pulling smaller things apart.

into a tight coil.  Overlapping scales gleam in a spectrum of hues, a 
luminous, multi-coloured sheath which seems to pulsate with every movement.

curved fangs visible protruding from its upper palatte.  A forked, black 
tongue darts out as blind eyes survey the surroundings, tasting the air 
cautiously.

A mighty stone golem with massive wings hovers here.
~
This golem is huge, it hovers off the ground, held there by mighty stone 
wings which beat with magical rhythm.  The stone body of this golem seems 
supple as it moves with grace which has obviously been bestowed upon it by 
magic means.  Its face is set with a hard look, unyeilding, impassive and 
defintely not willinging to talk.  Stone covers its body, looking close you 
can see an engraving over the golems heart, the initials T.D are inscribed 
here.  Slashed across the golems front are three words, 
                      "United in knowledge".

`#`WChapter 2. How do I move and talk?`^
                        
`YSTEP 1. `^Type `cN`^, this will move you north. Type `chelp move`^ for more detail. If you get lost type `crecall`^. To follow someone type `cfollow <person/keyword>`^.
   
`#`YSTEP 2. `^Try these things with an object: `cget <object>`^, `cdrop <object>`^,`c wear <object> `^and `cremove <object>`^. With drinking containers you can `cfill <object>`^ and `cempty <object>`^. To give an object to someone `cgive <object> <person/keyword>`^.
  
`#`YSTEP 3. `^*You have maps when you start!* To view them type `clook map`^ and `clook 2.map`^.
   
`#`YSTEP 4. `^If you cannot speak human, refer to chapter-7 (`clook chapter-7`^) as human is the main spoken in character language on dawn. Try these commands:
    
`c ooc hello`^                    This is a real life channel.
`c say hello`^                    This sends a message to the room.
      
You cannot say or ask anything IC (in character) on the OOC channel, but you may talk about real life issues here. To get into the chat rooms type `cgoooc`^ then you may talk about real life using `csay`^.
   
Note: If you are confused about the difference between OOC(Real life/out of character) and IC(In character) ask your friendly newbie helper! :)
 
Note: `RYou cannot swear either OOC or IC. `^Read `chelp swear`^ and `chelp rules`^ for more detail.

34 chapter-3 ~
`#`WChapter 3. How do I look at my stats/score/character information/configuration?`^
        
`YSTEP 1. `^These commands will give you character information. Type these out and see what they do!
            
          `cSCORE`^   shows your character stats, experience and level.
          `cWORTH`^   shows your tiredness, how much gold and other info.
          `cSKILL`^   shows you the skills and realms/spheres you have.
          `cAFFECT`^  shows if you are affected by any spells.
          `cSPELL`^   shows the spells you may cast.
          `cAUTO`^    shows what configuration you are set to.
          `cINV`^     shows what you have in inventory.
          `cWIMPY`^   sets the amount of hp you flee from combat.
          `cPANIC`^   sets the amount of hp you recall from combat.
          
`YSTEP 2. `^If you type `ccommands`^, it shows a list of commands. WARNING: long list!
        
`YSTEP 3. `^For the magic users of the realm, typing `ccspinfo <class>`^ gives you a list of spells for that class. ie. cspinfo mage
      
On a side note, please be patient in learning spells, once you `Ylevel`^ you gain spells - unless you learn some other way! ;)

34 chapter-4 ~
`#`WChapter 4. How do I get a 'long description' and 'short' description?`^
  
`YSTEP 1. `^Type `cdlook`^. Your LONG is what you see when you `clook <person>`^. It is a good idea to write down on paper what you want your character to look like. Read `chelp long`^ before you type in your description. Once you have an idea, type out these commands using this as an example:
     
`#   `cdesc `^(enter editor)
    `cAn elf with brown hair is here.`^ (enter your own description)
                        
    `^NOTE: `RYou are in the editor at this point you cannot talk or action. 
                           To get out of it and talk type `c@`^.
    
    `c .h`^ (for help)
    `c .s`^ (for show)
    `c .f`^ (format...word wrapping is your friend!)
    `c @ `^ (indicates finish and now you can type `csay`^ once again.)
   
`YSTEP 2. `^A SHORT is what you see when someone walks into the room. Eg. `BA tall blonde man is standing here. `^Read `chelp short`^ before asking an immortal to set your short.
   
`#`YSTEP 3.`^ After this you can be `Yletgained`^. Read `chelp history`^ and `chelp histor-requirements`^ - `R*IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS YOUR HISTORY MAY BE DECLINED!*`^ Histories are to be entered by typing `chistory`^ and filling it out as you did your long description and may be posted upon our yahoo group upon request. You may look at other currently online players' histories by typing `chlook <person>`^. When in doubt, ask an immortal. Finally type `crequestletgain <your short>`^ Eg. requestletgain a brown haired elf (Note: Do not include punctuation at the end.)

34 chapter-5 ~
`#`WChapter 5. How do I buy and wear things?
  
`YSTEP 1. `^ Go to the Armory on the map. If you can't find it ASK someone by typing `csay Where is the Armory?`^ or look at your map.
  
`YSTEP 2.`^ Once at the armory you need clothes! Type `clist 1 `^(1 is for your level). You will see a list come up somthing like this:
 
 [ 1    42 -- ] a leather belt 
 [ 1    42 -- ] leather boots 
 `#[ `R1`^    93 -- ] leather sleeves 
  
`YSTEP 3.`^ Buy some level 1 equipment. Type `chelp buy`^ for more detail. Buy *SUGGESTED EQUIPMENT*: Belt, boots, leggings, vest, gloves, cap and sleeves. Now type `clist boot`^. If you have a list like this:
  
 [35  1050  1 ] some leather boots 
 [50  1500  1 ] some heavy leather boots 
 `#[ `R1`^    42 -- ] leather boots
  
`#You need to buy the level `R1`^ boot. Type buy `Y3`^.boot. The leather boots are `Y3`^rd on the list. Wear what you bought (refer to chapter-2).
 
`YSTEP 4.`^ After that go to the General store and buy a lamp, a waterskin and bread.
 
`YSTEP 5.`^ Type `cskill`^ to find out your `Yweapon skill`^. For example thieves use daggers. Go to the weapon shop on the map. Buy two (level 1) daggers. Type `cwear dagger`^ to wear the first one, then type `csecond dagger`^ to put the other dagger in your off hand. If you are cleric you would get a mace etc, all depending on your `Yweapon skill`^.

34 chapter-6 ~
`#`WChapter 6. How do I gain experience and levels?`^
     
There are TWO ways to gain experience: Roleplay and combat.
    
`YSTEP 1. ROLEPLAY:`^ Yes roleplaying gives you experience, it is an automatic system! Type `chelp emote`^. Try this example: `cemote smiles softly.`^
    
`YSTEP 2.`^ Type `csocial`^. Warning: long list!
 
`YSTEP 3. `^If an immortal or noble sees you roleplaying well, you may get MOOTED. If you feel like living on the edge type `chelp quester`^. Dawn has `Yboth`^ autoquests and player/imm ran quests.
    
`#`YSTEP 4. COMBAT:`^ Good places to fight when you start is the park in Tulgard and if you start in Throtyl try killing pigeons in the town. Type `carea`^ to see the different areas in which you can fight and explore, another long list! 
   
`YSTEP 5.`^ Before battle checklist: 
`Y* `^Have you bought a weapon(s) and armor?
`Y* `^Have you practiced your weapon skill to 75% (70% for barbarians)?
`Y* `^Have you trained your hp? 
`Y* `^Do you have wimpy and panic set?
      
`YSTEP 6.`^Type `cconsider <mobile/monster>`^. It will show you a rating of what your chances are of winning against it. If you feel lucky type `ckill <mob>`^. Killing mobs earn you gold and experience. To cast a spell, `cc 'spell name' <person/monster> `^. Eg. c 'fireball' goblin

34 chapter-7 ~
`#`WChapter 7. How do I Practice and Train to gain more skills and spells?`^
    
Before you go to fight something it is a good idea to practice your weapon skill. To do this you need to find your GUILD hall.
    
`YSTEP 1.`^ Type `cscore`^, it will show your `Yclass`^. Each class has a `Yguild`^. Eg. If I was a mage I would want to find the arcanum. Use your map to find the location. If you can't find it, type `crecall`^ and ask someone.
   
`YSTEP 2.`^ Once in your guild, type `cgain list`^, `cpractice`^, and `ctrain`^. It is best to `ctrain hp`^. Type `chelp attribute`^ for more detail.
  
`YSTEP 3.`^ If you don't have human, type `cgain human`^. Then after this type `cpractice human`^. Practice it until it is 75% (70% for barbarians.) Although you do not have to practice this is it recommended.
  
`YSTEP 4.`^Type `cskill`^ and find your weapon skill, the `cpractice <weaponskill>`^ Eg. practice sword, until it is at 75%. Then type `cscore`^ to see if you have any trains or practices and if you have used them as you would like.
  
`YSTEP 6.`^To get spells you need to have the SKILLS of `Yrealms`^, `Yshperes`^, `Yelements`^ or `Yseasons`^. When you PRACTICE these skills your chance improves to learn a spell when you level.  
 
You cannot 'gain spells' here. You gain spells by `Ylevelling `^and other methods.
   
Now you are ready to start `Ya`Rd`Cv`Be`Gn`Mt`ru`Wr`Yi`Rn`gg`B!`^

34 chapter-8 ~
`#`WChapter 8. What do I do when I'm dead?`^
 
Usually what happens is the gods bless you and you get a second chance. *wink* If you die in a battle against a mob you get transported up to purgatory.
  
`YSTEP 1. `^Well, don't just sit there! Type `crecall`^ and return.
 
`YSTEP 2. `^You are completely naked like you were at the start. Find where your body is or if you don't think you can, ask someone by typing `csay Could you please help me get my equipment back?`^ 
 
`YSTEP 3. `^If you cannot seem to get it back, buy some new things and continue to explore. Remember it is a game and nearly everyone dies once or twice... or even more!
 
`YSTEP 4. `^If you are `Yplayer killed`^, this is different. 
 
`RYou *must* write a pkill note TO PKILL no more half an hour real life past the time you killed someone or were killed.`^
  
It will display a pkill message when this happens in `RRED.`^ Ask a newbie helper how to write notes if you do not know how.
  
`YSTEP 5. `^Dawn has a `Ykarn`^ system. Karns are your lives and you get a maximum of five karns. You can only pkill if you are LETGAINED. But you can be pkilled if you are not letgained. You may get letgained as low as level 1.

34 chapter-9 ~
`#`WChapter 9. How do I heal?`^
  
`YSTEP 1. `^The best thing to do if you are hurt and not 'tired' is to type `crest.`^
 
`YSTEP 2. `^Sometimes you are poisoned. When this happens type `crecall`^ and find a healer. Once in the healers type `cheal`^ and it will bring up a list. Or better yet, ask someone for help, making friends and having fun on dawn is what we aim for.
  
`YSTEP 3. `^If you are past level 6, a message like this could appear on the screen:
 
You are tired.
 
If this happens find a safe place and type `csleep`^ and `Ywait`^ until you fall asleep. Hunger and thirst heightens the chance you will get tired quicker.
 
`YSTEP 4. `^Sleeping or resting by fires and bedrolls gives you a better chance of recovering quicker. To pass the time while your character is sleeping, read notes by typing `cnote`^ or `cidea`^ or even read our mythos `chelp mythos.`^
 
References : `chelp REST`^, `chelp NOTES`^,`c help MYTHOS`^ and `chelp TIRED`^.

34 chapter-final~
`#`WChapter 10. Final advice!`^
  
`Y*`^ When stuck, ask a friendly newbie helper.
 
`Y*`^ Be nice to newbie helpers and immortals, you never know when they might come in handy ;)
  
`Y*`^ The SCAN skill is good when adventuring.
 
`Y*`^ Look at your prompt. Your prompt can tell you alot about your character including hit points, movement, mana and time of day. Type `chelp prompt`^ for a clear explanation.
   
`Y*`^ Unless you intend to roleplay, generally buying equipment higher than your level is not beneficial.
 
`Y*`^ Explore as much as possible and be prepared to make mistakes and die.
 
`Y*`^ When you see 'you are tired' appear try and sleep or you will find that your character will pass out.
  
`Y*`^ Make as many friends as you can and maybe later on join one of our CLANS.
 
`Y*`^ Have FUN!
 
You have read the newbie book, any questions please ask a `Ynewbie helper`^ or on the `Yquestion channel`^. Good luck!

34 chapter-1 ~
`#`WChapter 1. How do I find someone to help me?`^
          
If you don't understand something type `chelp <subject>`^ - <subject> is any keyword you wish to find help on. If you cannot understand this there are people who will help you.
  
`YSTEP 1. `^Type `cwho`^ and look at the list. You might see players like this:
   
      [***] Ka 
      [+++] Zyria
  `r-======= `GIMMORTALS `r=======-
      `G[`rDEM`G] Yonae`^
    
                  ....this means Zyria is a 'newbie helper' the [+++] indicates this. You can also ask an immortal if they are present, in this example the immortal is Yonae.
          
`YSTEP 2. `^For example, type `ctell Zyria help me please`^ and the player will respond to any questions you may have. 
    
`YSTEP 3. `^If there is no [+++] player. Type `cooc help me please.`^
      
`YSTEP 4. `^Alternatively, type `cquestion <your question>`^ to ask a question on the question channel.
    
Ettiquette is important on dawn and `Rit is a rule to not share or ask character information over OOC`^. 
     
References`^ : `chelp WHO`^, `chelp OUT OF CHARACTER`^ and `chelp -CHANNELS`^.

94 stellar gateway~
A large round device stands on the platform to the Stellar Gateway, with 
strange symbols arrayed in a circle around a large red glowing dome. The 
gateway itself is 30' in diameter, and has the same strange symbols around 
it on an inner ring, with an outer ring with 5 large triangles set about the 
outside. When 5 symbols on the small device are pressed, the inner ring of 
the gateway spins and the triangles light up one at a time as the proper 
symbol passes underneath it. Once all 5 symbols are pressed in a correct 
order, the red dome lights up. It can then be pressed, and a shimmering 
silver gateway appears inside the inner ring of the Stellar Gateway.

Limbo~
~
You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

A bright green clearing~

You awaken to find youself in a beautiful glade.  Light dances through the 
leaves, making kalidescopic patterns on the forest floor.  You can hear the 
quiet, comforting murmur of a small brook, and you are surrounded by peace 
and calm.  The soft scent of lilac and honeysuckle wafts through the air, 
mixed with the smell of freshly-baked sweets.  Even the grass beneath your 
feet seems more lush than any you have ever seen and everything around you 
is vibrant with with colors and sounds of life.  `1Around you, the trees go so high you can't make out their end.  The light 
that comes from above, passing through the many leaves, shows a great and 
colourful pattern on the floor and all around you.

A bright green clearing~
~
You awaken to find youself in a beautiful glade.  Light dances through the 
leaves, making kalidescopic patterns on the forest floor.  You can hear the 
quiet, comforting murmur of a small brook, and you are surrounded by peace 
and calm.  The soft scent of lilac and honeysuckle wafts through the air, 
mixed with the smell of freshly-baked sweets.  Even the grass beneath your 
feet seems more lush than any you have ever seen and everything around you 
is vibrant with with colors and sounds of life.  `1Around you, the trees go so high you can't make out their end.  The light 
that comes from above, passing through the many leaves, shows a great and 
colourful pattern on the floor and all around you.

Path of the Damned~
~
You are walking on what seems to be a path formed out of an endless rib
cage.  Huge vertebrae stretch out as a walk way under your feet, preventing
you from falling into the seemingly endless abyss below.  Huge ribs stick
out from the infinitely long spinal cord, towering over you.  It is eerily
quiet all around you, the only sounds are the ones you make.
