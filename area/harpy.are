Szkige harpy matriarch~
Szkige, the Harpy Matriarch~
A filthy yet commanding Harpy glares about herself in an imposing manner.
~
Somewhat larger than most Harpies, Szkige is proud and arrogant. Twisted 
scars cover her face in a testament to former battles, often with her own 
kind. Her head and torso are those of a woman, but her nether regions and 
wings are those of some monstrous carrion bird. Her feathers are a dusty 
black.

Gotarsh Harpy bodyguard~
Gotarsh, the Harpy Matriarch's bodyguard~
A powerful Harpy dominates the area with her forceful presence.
~
Resembling a vulture with the head and torso, Gotarsh is arrogant and 
evil. Wattled flesh hangs grotesquely beneath her chin. Her flesh is 
covered in a multitude of scars. Her hair is twisted and tangled, and 
filled with small sticks and bones.

Harpy warrior~
a Harpy warrior~
A Harpy warrior glares around menacingly.
~
A filthy yet strong Harpy warrior watches all that occurs with a 
mistrustful gaze. Her hair is filthy, as is her skin. Scars mark her head 
and torso, and feathers have been torn from her wings. Occasionally, she 
belches loudly.

a Harpy adult~
An adult Harpy wanders around aimlessly.
~
Bedraggled feathers droop from this Harpy's wings. Bones and filth mat her

Harpy fledgling~
a Harpy fledgling~
A nasty little Harpy fledgling stalks around angrily.
~
This young Harpy has never known any love in her short life. Her eyes are 
filled with anger and hatred. Tattered pinions trail behind her as she 
moves about. Angry squawks fall frequently from her lips.

Harpy guardian~
the Harpy guardian~
The Harpy Guardian stands here, watching vigilantly over the Harpy young.
~
A massive Harpy covered in scars, it is the Guardian's job to watch over 
the young, and protect them from outside predators. She shows them no 
attention, acting only to keep others from them until they have grown old 
enough to join the flock. One eye has been ripped from her skull, and a 
large scar stretches from her forehead to her chin. Her wings are sleek 
and powerful. Unlike the other Harpies, she is merely dirty, rather than 
filthy.

Zlota, the Harpy warrior~
A Harpy warrior stands here with a fierce scowl.
~
Wearing a necklace of bones, Zlota has a deep scar on her collarbone and 
another on one ear. Her golden hair is streaked with the mud and grime 
that covers the rest of her body. Varying in shades of rust and umber, two 
powerful wings extend from her back.

~
Katarzyna's brown hair is uneven and scraggly, matted with filth and dirt. 
Her wings are missing various flight feathers and shows signs of plucking. 
Her grey eyes look weary and worried, her claws constantly clacking 
together irritably.

a mountain goat~
A wild mountain goat grazes here.
~
This skinny mountain goat has an off white pelt and small horns. It's only 
as tall as a halfling, and its knobbly legs seem barely strong enough to 
support it. Hooded and placid, its amber eyes gaze about in a daze.

A Ledge to a Pass~

A narrow ledge hugs the cliff face.  The cliff rises steep and 
implacable above and below the trail.  A few determined plants 
grow from crevices in the rock.  Birds fly past, mocking in 
their ease of movement.

a pass through the cliff.  The wind gusts angrily, as if furious at 
the potential escape of its prey.  Birds careless enough to fly close 
thrash their wings in panic as they attempt not to be slammed brutally 
against the cliff face.

This narrow winding trail passes between towering rock walls. Along the 
edge of the trail, a few hardy plants struggle to thrive. High overhead, 
only a narrow crack permits access to the sky. No wind can be felt in this 
area, which is arid and dry. To the west, there seems to be a crevice 
that's large enough to fit through.

Rock walls press close against the trail on either side.  In places 
the trail narrows until there is no more than three feet between the 
walls.  An occasional centipede or scorpion scuttles across the path, 
before disappearing into small crevices at the base of the walls.  
There is hardly any wind within the narrow pass.

Before the Harpy Terrace~
~
The pass opens out onto the edge of a terrace. Once thick grasses have 
been ground into the noxious mud. Few birds fly overhead, perhaps 
disdaining the unwholesome environment. The wind whips sharply, scented of 
salt and other, less pleasant odors.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
Once covered in thick green grass, the terrace here is now marked with 
clawed prints in a muddy morass. A few stalks of withered brown grass are 
all that remains of the once luxuriant carpeting that used to be here. 
Scattered white splatters give evidence of the lack of fastidiousness 
displayed by the current inhabitants.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
The terrace is covered in stinking mud. Only a few scattered stalks of 
withered grass indicate the presence of its once-thick carpet. Poorly made 
buckets hold rotting fish and other marine life. The carcass of some 
unidentifiable large creature rots into the mud.

Random clawed tracks line the thick, oozing mud. Piles of scales and fish 
bones lie everywhere, decaying into the muck. Although the lake can be 
heard below, its salty scent cannot be discerned over the stronger noxious 
odors. Cairns of stones are piled up for no apparent reason.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
Dank mud oozes over the edge of the cliff. Fish bones and scales are piled 
in untidy profusion. The wind whips through harshly, spreading the scent 
of decay. The lake slams against the cliff below.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
This section of the caves holds the Harpy young. Rough nests of twigs and 
other less recognizable objects are littered about in haphazard profusion. 
Sounds of violent squabbling often end in a pain-filled yelp. Bones of 
fish and other creatures are scattered about the floor, some with decaying 
shreds of meat still upon them.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
Young Harpies wander about the cave. Noisome nests are filled with various 
matter, some with eggs, others with mounds of reeking furs. One nest bears 
a shattered egg with fluids dripping from it, lending the impression that 
the young Harpies are not exactly picky about what they eat.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
Nests laced together from twigs and bones and other objects are scattered 
about the floor. Some hold eggs, others hold furs where Harpy young may 
sleep. In one nest it is almost certain that the rotting pelt is that of a 
Pixie. Scattered feathers in the nest bolster that impression.

The Harpy Terrace~
~
Harpy young roam the caves without any attempt at discipline. More often 
than not, they attack each other on sight. Scattered unpleasant nests 
provide resting places for both untended eggs, and untended young. 
Unpreserved pelts line some of the nests.

Uneven perches of dead wood provide resting places for those who wish it. 
Bedraggled feathers of various hues lift on stray breezes. Bones,

The mangled carcass of some small creature has been abandoned here. Ragged 
perches of dead wood are scattered about haphazardly. Debris from various

Manacles attached to the walls with short chains give the impression this 
chamber is intended to hold prisoners. Bedraggled feathers drift about the 
room whenever the breeze dares to enter. A leaking bucket holds a small 
amount of water coated in an unpleasant scum. Smears of some reddish brown 
substance splatter the walls.

Most of the nests in this section of the cave have been ripped apart. 
Noisome splatters decorate the floor in shocking glares of white. 
Trickling water dribbles down the walls.

of a Pixie child.

The remains of some unknown large creature are strewn about the floor in 
disarray. Feathers lift sullenly in the wayward breezes. Scattered bits of 
bone and hide indicate the former presence of smaller creatures. Scorpions 
and other insects scuttle through the remains in search of dinner.

The Harpy Throne Room~

A large perch covered in flaking gold leaf is the central focus of this 
chamber. Widespread wings of Pixies unfortunate enough to wander into the 
Harpies' territory are displayed upon the walls in a mocking parody of 
their former glory. Bones and hides are distributed across the floor in 
uncaring untidiness. A battered golden crown is hung on one end of the 
perch.

A Ledge on the Mountainside~
~
The mountainside is littered with boulders and pebbles, odd spurts of 
grass growing at sporadic intervals. This wide ledge goes on towards the 
east, but ends in a sheer cliff on the north and the south. From above, 
harpy screeches can be heard. Every now and then, feathers flutter down to 
gather upon this messy ledge.

The wide ledge ends here, though a narrow path to the north leads down 
from the ledge to wind along the mountain. Shell fragments and bones 
picked clean of meat have been dropped here. Bird cries echo through the 
air, and the sparse trees contain nests of hawks and vultures.

about this peaceful area. From here, vast stretches of grassland can be

A Narrow Path Around a Cliff~
~
With a sheer cliff face looming above to the southeast and an equally 
dangerous drop to the north, this path is narrow and barely traversible by 
foot. Thistles and weeds grow between the rocks here. A beautiful view of 
grasslands and distant forests can be seen to the north.

This treacherous path is hard to follow, obscured mostly by plants and 
boulders. It leads upwards to a small cliff, and downwards to the base of 
the mountain. Small flowers of white and pale yellow are visible at the 
edge of the cliff above.

stream here. Tall trees provide cool shade while birds sing from the 
branches.

At the Top of a Cliff~
~
From this cliff, the northern forests and eastern grasslands are easily 
visible, forming a breathtaking panoramic view. The lonely cries of eagles 
echo in the mountains and cool gusts of wind whip past this ledge. Flowers 
thrive along the edge of the cliff, interspersed with herbs and shrubs.

A Widening Crevice~
~
Opening up to the sky above, this crack through the formidable stone walls 
leads from the main pass towards a dark cavern to the west. The arid air 
is cooler here, the small hidden path shaded from the harsh sunlight by 
the stone enveloping it. Small weeds grow out of the rock itself, some 
obstructing the narrow path.

A Cool Cavern~
~
The crystalline sound of water drops echo about this cavern. Illuminated 
naturally through a single gap in the stone to the north, the cave can be 
recognized as a mineral deposit. Crystals sparkle in the gentle light, 
covering the walls of the cave with a dozen hues. The center of the cavern 
has a small campfire crackling quietly and filling the area with a glow.
