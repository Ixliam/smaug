half out of his mouth. His clothes are stained and have a particular odor. 
As he mumbles to himself, the words are even more coherent as they are 
babbled out with his tongue at the odd position.

a spunky girl~
A spunky girl circles with a half-destroyed rattan blade.
~
This spunky girl with flaming red hair darts to and fro, her feet gliding 
effortlessly even has her face streams sweat. The edge of her rattan blade 
darts like a viper in complicated circles before slashing a defense quickly.

a grizzled trainer~
A grizzled trainer circles with a broken shield.
~
Seasoned and hard, the man circles without pausing to rest. His feet make up 
for any lack of grace with careful deliberation and an almost unconscious 
caution. His eyes watch everything carefully looking for openings.

khanesh nervous boy~
a nervous-looking dargorst boy~
A nervous-looking dargorst boy paces frantically.
~
While immaculately dressed, this boy has obviously had little sleep and it 
shows.  Deep crimson robes cover his deep caramel skin from neck to 
ankles, bedecked with enough jewels to start a gemsmithing business. 
Meanwhile, his hair has seen better years and his eyes have enough baggage 
to run away.

A gift of Sultans to Sultanas, this set of earrings carries the blood of our 
people within it. For those who consent they allow a wonderous gift. They 
may be used to bridge the gap of minds. To do so, all one must do is share 
them with each other and each allow the blood of our people to touch your 
skin. As a gift of love.. they may only be used willingly. The curse of the 
sands upon those who'd seek to escape this edict.

Before the Labyrinth~
~
All around you are the tall grasses and thickets that grow rampantly upon 
the plains of Mithas.  A short distance west, however, there appears to be a 
rather large rock outcropping.  Around it's base, the rock rises almost 
completely vertical for a hundred feet before rounding off.  At the highest 
point the hillock must reach about three hundred feet.  A small, dark cavern 
entrance can be seen in the distance to the west.

The Labyrinth~
~
This room contains hundreds of skeletons of various creatures.  Most of the 
bones resemble humanoid races, but there are some exceptions.  The giant 
skeletal head of a dragon stares at you with it's lower jaw dislocated and 
hanging from only one joint.  Another pile of bones once belonged to 
something which possessed four arms and six legs.  It seems as if this was 
the end of the road for many who chose the wrong path.

Center of the Labyrinth~
~
You have made it into the center of the labyrinth.  The area is open, but a 
magic field shimmers high above you, sealing this area from the outside 
world.  The grass is short but quite soft.  This open field is walled in on 
all sides by sheer cliffs rising a hundred feet into the air.

This small cavern look to be home to some small creature.  There are two 
chairs made of hewn logs and padded with a thick moss.  A small table made 
from a cleft rock sits between the chairs and has a neat cloth covering the 
center.  A firepit lies in the middle of the cave, but the wood piled within 
is unlit.  Many strange carvings adorn the walls, each depict a twisting 
body frozen in an odd dance.

The stench of decaying matter fills this chamber, adding to the gloominess 
that has been established by a shroud of darkness.  The looming shadows mesh 
seemlessly with the arching thatch from which this abode has been 
constructed.  Lifeless corpses of many creatures furnish this den, their 
bones coverd by an odd, slimy substance.  The only exit out of these feeding 
grounds is to the east.

You have reached the source of the vaporous plume that escapes from this

water steadily drains into a large hole in the floor.  A jet of warm steam
is ejected from the geyser, shooting rapidly through the opening high above.
Every so often a reddish glow flares up within the geyser, only to fade as
quick as it appeared.  The caven is traversable to the west, following along

Cold, damp air seeps into your bones down here, and you are not even sure
how far below ground you have descended to reach this room.  Calmor must
really enjoy seclusion to remove himself this far from any other intelligent
beings.  The air smells quite musky and rancid due to the lack of any
substantial ventilation.  There is a stone door set in the eastern wall, and
a large portal opens into another room to the west.

the face of Krynn.  But one of these corpses towers above the rest,
dominating the room.  The skin of this slain dragon still shimmers with the
golden tones that set it's place in life.  Beyond all the complete remains
Calmor has collected are the souveniers he has acquired.  There is a
wyvern's sting, the arm of a kender, and many other extremities litter the
dusty shelves here.  A wide portal leads to another room east of here.

You have entered the chambers of Calmor the Violent, the most
sought-after outlaw on the island of Mithas.  The walls are covered in
velvet tapestries, each depicting a minotaur fighting some creature with his
bare hands.  A large pile of bug-ridden hides serves as crude bedding that
even a goblin would abstain from laying on.  There is a small, round oak
table with a matching chair set in the corner.  Upon the table is some
unused parchment, a quill, and a spent candle.  Hanging on the south wall is
a two-handed axe with a massive steel head.

does not seem to be a way to open the doors from this side, maybe someone 
stands watch on the other side and would open them.

to drive some unseen mechanism.  The contraption operates with absolute

that touches your skin feels as if it will blister horribly if you remain

making it hard to breath and almost impossible to see more than five feet
away.  A bright reddish light blazes in a crevase to the west, and waves of
heat blast from that direction as well.  The smoke seems to thin out to the

a steel breastplate, the final resting spot for some unfortunate minotaur
explorer.  The wall looks to have a number of protrusions that will allow
you to scale up this shaft.

skeleton~
The skeleton seems to be fused with the rock in the wall, you can only
imagine the pain this minotaur felt in his last moments.  He seems to have
something around his arm that you should be able to work free.

Middle of the gully hole~
~
By bracing your arms and legs against one wall, and pressing your back to
the other, you can manage vertical movement through this hole.  A steady
trickle of water rains down from above, making your grip a little slippery. 
From the sound of the splashing below, you figure you are not far from the
bottom at this point.  Looking up you can see the entrance to this shaft a
short climb away.

Bottom of the gully hole~
~
You stand knee deep in water, which is steadily pouring down from a hole
far above you.  Something slithers around your ankles, but the murky water
makes it impossible to see what it was.  The walls down here are covered by
sparkling green lichens, lending an odd visage to your surroundings.  A
small orifice is set in the wall before you, from which a steady runnel of
blue slime oozes forth.  From here, you can only manage to climb up the
shaft, since there are no other exits.

Inside the cleft~
~
This area has formed from a cleft in the rock of the crater rim.  It is very 
hot in here, but the air seems cleaner than it was outside.  You can 
navigate further into the cleft to the north, or climb back out here.

Inside the cleft~

The cleft has begun to constrict sharply, and you can barely squeeze your 
way through this spot.  It seems a little cooler here than it has been, 
which is odd considering you must be pretty close to the lava that was in 
the crater.  You could probably manage to work your way down a bit further, 
or you could head south where it becomes much wider.

This room appears to be a lair of sorts, the likes of which are not of this 
plane.  Flames appear to crackle wildly around you, but it is not the least 
bit hot here.  A pentagram has been drawn upon the floor, surrounded by many 
runic characters of some unknown script.  There are many outlines of 
skeletal figures burned into the floor around the pentagram as well.

Champion's way~

The road comes to an intersection at this point.  To the west, a plaza that 
is lined with ornate lanterns leads away from the capital.  To the east 
stands an archway which heads off into the gardens of Lacynos.  To the 
south, Champion's Way leads directly into the heart of Lacynos.  Smooth 
cobblestones hedged in with limestone blocks provide a sturdy travelling 
surface for this wide, main artery.

This main road leads north towards the gardens and the coast of Horned Bay, 
as well as to the south into the heart of Lacynos.  Many mud brick dwellings 
line both sides of the street, each painted with intricate patterns done in 
vibrant colors.  As there is not much space between the homes, it would seem 
that the land comes at a premium within the city.

All around you, the bustle of the capital continues to produce an unending 
mixture of sights, sounds, and smells.  Many of the building throughout this 
area are made in a three-story manner, each floor having it's own outside 
enterance serviced by a steep stairwell.  This type of construction denotes 
most of these buildings to be homes for the lower class of Mithas.  A small, 
one-story building located on the eastern side of the street proudly bears a 
sign depicting a helmet and a warhammer.

At this point along Champion's Way, a sturdy looking building to the east 
houses what appears to be an armor smith.  To the south, the conjested 
street opens up into the open market square.  Heavy wear in the cobblestones 
gives you a rough idea of the age of this minotaur capital.

through the square.  The gleaming spires of the palace lie just a short way 
to the southeast of here, and roads lead in all directions.

with only a few flat wood benches and a stone altar in the center of the 
room.  The walls are adorned with murals of massive battles in which the 
avatar of Tyr stands in the center, watching all around.  The surface of the 
altar is well-worn, as many of the citizens of Lacynos pay hommage to this 
god of war.

This section of the city is less-traveled by it's populace.  Most of the 
buildings are in disrepair here.  There is one notable exception though, a 
small building to the north that is hewn from a smooth green rock.  Many 
cracks upon it's surface pulse with a magical glow in random hues.  A plaque 
fastened above the doorway reads "Mizoth's Arcana".

wall, and this is also bare.  A lavishly woven rug adorns the floor, and 
this depicts a half-invisible human smiling.  It seems that this shop has 
been empty for quite some time now.

The pier seems sturdy underfoot. The boards that make it up are wide and are 
approximately seven feet wide. They have been tightly bonded together with 
strong nails and ropes. Underneath the dock, heavy wooden supports are 
visible. The water laps gently against them and makes a soothing repetitive 
noise.

The dock seems sturdy underfoot. The boards that make it up are wide and are 
approximately seven feet wide. They have been tightly bonded together with 
strong nails and ropes. Underneath the dock, heavy wooden supports are 
visible. The water laps gently against them and makes a soothing repetitive 
noise. To your west lies the ship Her Triumphant Majesty.

Dock~
~
The ship Her Triumphant Majesty is docked here. The gangplank to the North 
is barred by a fierce looking, brawny minotaur. He snarls at you as you 
approach. Inside the ship you can hear laughter. Leaning around the 
minotaur, you catch a glimpse of a cigar girl. Perhaps you should talk to 
the guard before you go any further.

As you step onto the ship, you immediately recognize that an illegal 
gambling operation has been set up on this royal vessel. Sounds of cards 
being dealt, winners yelling out gleefully, and the losers sobbing reaches 
your ears. The air is smokey due to all of the cigars that are lit in the 
area.

This section of the ship has a few scattered couches and chairs. The people 
that mill around this area have very large grins on their faces, and when 
they leave, their pockets are obviously lighter. A man is laying back on a 
chaise lounge.

A poker game has been set up in this corner of the bottom level of the ship. 
A pit boss hovers near the gamblers and watches for any cheating. The green 
covered table has no other objects on it besides cards. Waitresses flit back 
and forth from the table with drinks for the gamblers.

A blackjack table has been set up here. The gamblers sit on the southern 
side of the table, as the dealer stands on the northern side and watches 
hawklike over the cards. He nods silently to a ship guard, and the guard 
removes a cheater from the table, thus opening up a free spot for another 
gambler.

Metal tables with attached rows of seats have been bolted here into the 
floor. The tables are crowded with drunks slumped over the tabletops while 
others try to eat, talk, or count their last bits of money. Some of the 
drunks moan softly as the rocking of the boat in the water jars them.

The heady scent of cigars fills the area here. Smoke rolls over the patrons

makes her way around the room as she calls out, "Cigars, cigarettes?" Tables 
have been set up here, but ashtrays fill every space on them.

This corner of the ship is darkened by the entranceway. In the shadows you 
can see the faint outline of a hunched over man. A cough racks the man's 
body, and you step away hesitantly, but he beckons you forward. No one seems 
to speak in this corner of the ship, and all transactions are done silently.

wafts over you as you stand here. Loud sounds come from the warehouse to 
your east.

Rows and rows of wooden cargo boxes are stacked up to the ceiling of the

to work through with very little breathing room. You can hear rustling

This corner of the warehouse is dark and rank. Wiping away the grime on one 
of the wooden cargo boxes you see that it is labeled produce. Another box 
seems to be labeled meats. Along the floor seems to be rotted pieces of 
produce and meat mashed together. It does not make for a pleasant sight as 
maggots worm their way over it.

Path to the palace~

You are before a black wrought iron gate. The iron has been twisted into 
intricate curls and designs. The gate seems to lead into the palace gardens. 
No guards stand at attention here at the gate, and it seems the gate is 
unlocked. To your northwest, the road leads back to the docks.

capital of the island of Mithas.  The gleaming spires of the royal palace 
can be seen reaching up from within the city walls.  A majestic row of 
ornate hanging oil lamps provides light to this plaza as it continues on 
its path towards the city.  The scent of the salty sea air wafts in gently 
from the west.

The grass grows quite long in this area, showing perhaps a slight lack of 
concern for this area. A fence stands at the back part of the garden. Even 
it seems to be adorned as vines creep in and out of the holes between fence 
pieces. Various statues seem to guard the fence, each small and intricately 
crafted. A gate lies to the east of here.

been mussed recently and a set of bronze scales from something removed

An ornate hallway, not a single spot can be seen that is in need of 
cleaning. A faint smell of apples comes from the wooden floor and violet 
carpetting. Towards the north and west the hallway continues.

Before a Glass Door~
~
An ornate hallway, not a single spot can be seen that is in need of 
cleaning. A faint smell of apples comes from the wooden floor and violet 
carpetting. Towards the east and west the hallway continues and towards the 
north a glass door beckons.

A Simple Solar~
~
This tidy sitting room for ladies has been roofed glass panelling. Above, 
light is refracted and reflected from a series of mirrors and chandeliers 
while being supported by a greenhouse-like skylight. Soft wood has been used 
on the floor and sprinkled with fresh blossoms to create a sedate and 
muffled atmosphere.

A Hallway Intersection~
~
This intersection of routes forms a large meeting hall with a staircase 
ascending from the center. To the west a delicate but sturdy door is mounted 
deep into the wall. To the east lies a enormous set of double doors. The 
hallway continues north and south.

An Unclean Bedroom~
~
What once might have been a beautiful and airy bedroom has been cluttered 
with various weapons, diagrams and clothing to the point where the floor's 
composition is suspect. Charts have been drawn on almost every available 
wall including the ceiling and either crossed out or circled. In the midst 
of this maelstrom, a bed little more than a few wooden plants nailed 
together with a sheet over it stands valiantly against the chaos.

A Formal Receiving Room~
~
Here one can find the accomodations expected for royalty. Here mahogany has 
been used without a care for cost. There lorken has been fashioned into a 
heavy and austere table. On one end a set of throne-like chairs covered in 
light dust have been set up. Around the rest of the table little more than 
stoles exist.

A Simple Study~
~
Homey and understated, the study possesses all the signs of repeated use. 
Worn chairs surround a large table with scribbles made directly on it. 
Towards the back of the room a desk directly attached to the wall has been 
repaired and re-repaired so many times little of the original material is 
apparent. Most noticably, little in this room exists to elicit awe or 
reverence.

The Hostel Room~
~
You are in the hostel room of the Jade Diamond. The curtains and other 
furnishings are a bit shabby but clean. The bed has been neatly pulled back 
for the night's visitor. A small crackling fire burns in the hearth. A tiny 
window looks out over the busy street.
