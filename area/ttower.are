way up to the tower on top. Vegetation is sparse on the trip up the steep 
climb, though the soil seems rich in nutrients with all the insects moving

shapes and sizes, yet arranged into a strange symbol. Along the ground, 
mice and grubs scurry along, yet not getting too near the entrance. 
Muffled sounds of screams and a horrible wailing can be heard.

Entrance Hall~

&wLarge bone pillars are placed along the four walls, supporting the upper 
structure. All around, everything is a monotonous gray, with the 
occasional red splash next to a decomposing, half eaten, corpse. A dull, 
green glow, can be seen coming from the stairs to the north.

Another Corner~
~
&wA once plush carpet, is now trodden with so much filth it's value is 
practically worthless. A small table in the corner holds yet another vase 
full of flowers--sadly, all are dead here as well.

Top of the Tower~
~
&wA bright green aura emanates from the powerful necromancer that inhabits 
this room, warily eyeing anything and everything that moves. A large 
pentagram can be seen off to the side of the stairwell, drawn in a rustic 
red color.
