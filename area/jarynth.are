A town watchman shivers in the cold as he hovers over the campfire.
~
The guard's guant figure wears a long surcoat of faded green, bronze plate armor and a beige woolen cloak. Brown hair is barely visible under the tall guard's hat, made of felt the same green as his surcoat. His face is weary and weathered by the intense cold of Jarynth.

citizen jarynth~
a citizen Jarynth~
A citizen of Jarynth wanders through the streets hoping to get some food.
~
Almost skin and bones, this thin man is dressed in what used to be the traditional garb of Jarynth but now just resembles rags. His lackluster brown hair is damp with snow and he constantly shivers while clutching his green peasant coat tighter about him. Hopeless brown eyes lack any spark of life, making him a sad sight to behold.

Brontus, the head baker~
A skeletal man greets you with a weak smile as he welcomes you to his store.
~
A constant worried frown on his gaunt face, Brontus has a small goatee and drooping green eyes. His brown hair is streaked with grey, more from stress than from age. Slouched in a morose fashion, his unhappy frame looks like it's wasting away and more bone than muscle. A tattered brown apron is tied messily around his thin waist.

Osholo~
Osholo gives you a fake smile as you walk into his store.
~
Greying hair slicked back, Osholo has a hawk-like face with a protruding nose. Green eyes glitter with sly cunning and his mouth is twisted up into an insincere smile. He wears a umber jacket with fox fur cuffs, though the luxurious coat cannot hide his starved build. He keeps his arms folded and his long, spidery fingers tap absently in repressed irritation.

hard to discern. His calloused hands are scarred and strong, used to a 
life of hard work. A gruff face is heavily wrinkled beyond its age, his 
brown eyes hooded wearily and his mouth twisted into a grimace.

Soapy~
A little black and tan dog barks at you, nipping at your heels.
~
Barking excessively at you, Soapy stands ready to attack anything that
may enter her territory.  Black in color with a tan underbelly, she stands
sternly at attention.  Tiny muscles ripple with aggression, while she flashes
a set of little white teeth as sharp as daggers.  Lowering her head, she
pulls her ears back against her skull.  Though her behavior and appearance
is that of a fierce doberman, her chihuahua-like size tells you that she's
nothing but a wannabe watch dog.

Watchman Manech~
A thin town watchman huddles around a campfire here, whittling a small wolf figurine.
~
Looking to be no older than twenty, this young guard wears the usual outfit of Jarynth's guards composing of  a long surcoat, bronze plate armor, and a woolen cloak. Slightly curling brown hair sticks out from under his tall guard's hat. A pair of sad green eyes stare down despondently at the snow.

Outskirts of Jarynth~
~
In the distance, the sleepy little village of Jarynth is tucked away in 
the vast hills and farmlands of the region. A few decrepit farmhouses can 
be spotted amidst the blanket of snow covering their fields, neglected and 
vacant of crops. Cold wind gusts about, howling through the forsaken 
plots.

are mostly buried by heavy snowfall. In the distance, the tall gates of 
Jarynth are visible to the northeast, as is the smoke from the village.

Unused plows lie scattered about the farmland, many rusted and worn down

Red, frozen earth lay at your feet, crackling under the weight of your
body as you trample across a farmer's field.  The air is cold here, 
sending a wintery chill through your body as you gaze across this field.
A distinct feeling of despair wraps its empty arms around your soul
freezing your heart like the seeds that were planted in the soil here
by a farmer who expected the icy weather to be gone just a few days
after he planted his crop.  A farmer can be seen standing on his front
porch to the north.

back and forth across the front porch of this small farmhouse that sits
at the edge of his barren crops.  An old, weathered rocking chair sits on
the porch, waiting for the warm days of summer to appear so that the farmer
and his wife can each sit in the rocker and sip ice cold lemonade.

along the dirt road.

Normally crowded with people moving about through Jarynth, the commons now 
lies eerily still as the cold hands of the unnatural winter hold the 
residents hostage within their homes and in their shops. A sense of silent 
dread looms over the town, the freezing wind howling through the streets. 
With each gust of wind, the corpse of a bandit swings from the gallows, 
hanged here in the square to remind the citizens of the price of theft.

Along the Witch's Walk, several wooden statues, symbols to ward off evil

Snow blankets the ground beneath your feet. A few bone-thin villagers 
shuffle through now and then, begging for scraps of food. The supply shop 
to the south and the armory to the north seem to be open, unlike the other 
shops in the area. The spacious street, despite the two shops, is devoid 
of energy and sound.

West Galatin Road~
~
The western gates of Jarynth tower at the end of the street, while to the 
east, the commons are visible. A heavy layer of snow has piled up around 
the street and against the uninhabited buildings nearby. Eerie silence 
prevades the area, though warm lamplight can be seen to the east.

Outside Western Gates of Jarynth~
~
The forest of ice and snow closely surrounds the western gates leading to 
Jarynth. The small clearing here has a weak campfire burning in the 
shelter of the tall gates. A layer of frost forms a glittering sheen upon 
the surface of the heavy gates. There seems to be a small gap in the 
frozen trees to the north, perhaps an animal trail of some sort.

Farmer's Necessities~
~
An amazing amount of unsold goods hang upon the walls of this humble shop. 
Several shiny horses' bridles hang in abundance from hooks upon the 
southern wall, while dozens of garden hoes stand upright within a large, 
metal urn resting in the corner. A wooden counter in the back of the room 
holds an almost empty coinbox. Muddy and damp from snow, the ground has 
old straw strewn about it.

The Envy of Knights~
~
Several winter coats stand on display in the store's front window, 
greeting each patron with a reminder that winter seems to be here to stay. 
Scores of freshly sewn dresses and heavy woolen clothes hang neatly in 
racks all throughout the store. Several shelves of neatly stitched 
trousers line the walls of this garment shop, waiting to be sold to anyone 
willing to pay the hefty price that has been placed on them.

Mira Circle~
~
This cobblestone road connects the village square with the cottages in the 
northern area. Streetlamps along the road are now cracked and empty of 
flame, leaving the path cold and gloomy. The plants and grass have been 
suffocated by the thick layer of snow heaped upon the roadside by the 
neverending blizzard.

Several inches of ice has frozen over the ground, making the path in front 
of the cottages extremely perilous. The small houses form neat rows along 
the path, with tufts of smoke rising from their stone chimneys. Icicles 
hang from the roofs, their dangerous points gleaming.

Candles flicker wildly in the windows of the cottages that line Mira 
Circle as blasts of chilling winds claw through the broken rooftops of the 
homes here. Inside the cottages, villagers huddle closely around weak 
fires that barely heat their rooms. Sleet comes down mercilessly, pouring 
ice and slush over the cobblestone path.

The ice-covered cobblestone path offers slippery footing and curves in 
front of a row of small cottages within the village. Snow-packed rooftops 
bow dangerously inward under the weight of months of heavy winter 
precipitation, causing the drawfty cottages to leak with the melted snow. 
Villagers can be seen huddling inside the homes miserably.

Mira Circle~
~
A chilling blast of wind blows snow across the cobblestone road that runs 
alongside the small cottages within Jarynth, making it nearly impossible 
to travel down the road. Small, withering tufts of smoke can be seen 
coming from the chimneys of the little cottages. A small, frozen road 
branches from Mira Circle, leading to a small graveyard where the victims 
of this harsh winter now lay in their frozen tombs of eternal sleep.

Mira Circle~
~
The long cobblestone road connects the circle of cottages within the 
village to Jarynth Square. The curses of the unnatural weather have laid 
their icy claws upon the small village, burying the fields and crops in 
freezing ice and snow. With no money to provide upkeep, the villagers have 
let their houses and lands go to ruin. All throughout the circle, roofs 
sag dangerously and doors show cracks through which harsh air whistles.

Trail of Frozen Tears~
~
The snowy path widens a little as it branches off Mira Circle and leads to 
the edge of town towards a small cemetary. The trees here are dense and 
bare of leaves, dead for years. Some are charred black. The frigid wind 
blows specks of ash up from the burned trees on the ground.

into the sky. Piles of rubble and charcoal clutter up the road, held in 
place by snow and ice. Silence hangs heavily over the area with oppressive 
pressure.

Wrought Iron Gate of Mortality~
~
A rusted iron fence surrounds this small cemetary on the outskirts of 
Jarynth. Frozen vines had once crept up the fence, entwining themselves 
with the decorative iron. Weeds have formed a matted wall along the fence. 
Blasting winds howl angrily against the looming gates leading in to the 
graveyard. Constructed of blackened wrought iron, the high gates have been 
forged with intricate designs and are supported by twin foundation blocks 
of cracked stone.

Dozens of small tombstones rest within this small graveyard on the edge of 
town, bearing witness of the strange blizzard's frozen wrath. Old ladies 
wailing at the foot of a fresh gravesite are seen everywhere. Young 
mothers cling to their children while they stand at the grave of their 
fathers who have died in the clutches of the frozen hand that clutches 
this tiny village.

Thick, white snowflakes fall like tears upon a carved tombstone which 
depicts a young mother cradling her small daughter. Delicate white flowers 
frozen by the cold lay scattered at the foot of this newly placed

birth and dying date, which shows she was only six upon death.

A Pathway Through the Ages~

Time marches on through the ages, though here in Jarynth, it seems to have
stood still as the wintery season continues to tighten its grip on the
tiny village in the hillside.  The graves of the former villagers stretch
throughout the area, as even the wealthiest of villagers now lay in the
cold, savage earth alongside the commoners.  A gravedigger's shack stands
on the edge of the cemetary in the distance.

around, soft and never ceasing.

A brass replica of a golden crown rests atop the headstone that marks
the final resting place of the village's beloved prince.  Several
mourners visit here every day, leaving gifts of rememberance at the
base of the headstone, while even the groundskeeper delivers a special
bouquet of buttercups to lay upon the grave every day.  Adorned with
the royal coat of arms, this grave now lays among the graves of the
common people, a testament that even a prince could not escape the
cold hands of death.

Several muddy footprints line the floors that haven't seen a mob or

farmer sits down to eat his meals.  Months of neglect have left their
mark upon this little farmhouse, causing wooden floors to creak with
every step you take.
