A large shaggy bear glares around itself malevolently. Its coat is 
tattered and unkempt. Foam drips from its slavering jaws. It exudes an 
aura of malevolence. Its eyes are vague, darting around it almost 
unseeing. It recoils from all that is near it, even such things as 
trees or boulders. Occasionally it swats out viciously at the air.

Thick rock walls rise up from a flagstone floor, with a slate ceiling
overhead.  The wooden door has been smashed off of its hinges by some
great force.  Wooden tables are covered in an assortment of arcane
esoterica, from beakers to less identifiable objects.

Tall trees reach proudly for the skies.  Birds sing merrily from 
the branches.  Squirrels chatter busily at the birds while stashing 
their nuts in hollows in some of the trees.  The blasted remains

Towering pines rise up like battle-ready lances against the sky.  Grubs 
writhe in a jagged tear in the side of one old tree.  The scent of pine 
needles is sharp and crisp throughout the forest.  A tuft of fur left 
behind on a brambly branch might be a souvenir from a bear.  A wrought
iron gate to the north is barely visible through the trees.

Sturdy conifers and ancient oaks thrive side by side in majestic 
prosperity.  Bees buzz busily, gathering pollen for honey.  A wise 
old horned owl blinks in lazy stupor from a crevice in an old oak.

A massive, gnarled, ancient oak dominates this section of forest.  
Knotted branches reach out from its base in all directions, alternately 
burrowing beneath and above the ground.  A single branch droops where 
it has been torn from the tree by its own great weight.

Trees cluster thickly about, leaning towards each other almost as if 
gossiping.  A mouse scurries from one small hole in the ground to 
another.  A thick carpet of pine needles blankets the ground.  A rock 
building nestles amongst the trees to the north.

Mushrooms grow in tiers from the sides of ancient trees.  Rocks 
speckled with lichens are scattered in the grass.  A droning bee 
moves lazily from flower to flower.  A chipmunk peers out from 
the hollow of a nearby tree.

Tall trees strive to grow taller than each other.  Luxurious 
mushrooms grow thickly from the sides of the trees.  A tiny brown 
wren sings a beautiful melody as if her heart is breaking.  A wee 
mouse stares up at the wren in bewildered wonder.

Growing undisturbed for many years, the trees are clustered thick 
and rise up high.  Occasionally, a few needles fall from a pine, 
striking the floor and adding to its thick carpeting.  Bees flit 
busily from flower to flower.

A tangled spiderweb stretches across the trail, tattered and whipped 
by the breeze.  A horde of tiny infant spiders scurry about it, 
blowing away from the web every once in awhile.  Eager birds feast 
upon this tiny bonanza.

Deciduous trees mingle with conifers in a natural display of peace 
amongst differences.  Mingled drifts of leaves and pine needles 
strengthen the impression.  A single locust bumbles lazily through 
the air with an iridescent green-gold sparkle.  A narrow trail of 
ants wends its way up a tree.

A large oak dominates a small clearing.  The mottled play of shadow 
on the trunk of the oak seems to illustrate the image of a face on 
the side of the old oak.  Green grass wraps around the base of the 
oak like a blanket wrapped around an old man.

Thick gnarled roots thrust out from the forest floor, ready to

Great trees rise high as far as the eye can see.  Birds soar

high overhead.  Old trees grow all about, unharmed by the hand of 
man.  Leaves stir fitfully in breezes.  Ants scurry busily across

The trees here seem to form a leafy hall.  Small openings in the hall 
lead to yet more forest.  The path is covered in verdant green grass 
down its center, tho mingled fallen leaves and pine needles line the edges.

The trees are thin here, making this more of a clearing than forest 
proper.  The grass here is short and sparse, and the dirt below shows 
through clearly.  An owl hoots mournfully from an unseen hiding place.

A long narrow green snake blends perfectly into the foliage until 
a chance movement betrays his presence.  Soft green grass carpets 
the floor of the forest.  Fungus grows like strange platters from 
the sides of the trees.  Tiny holes in the forest floor represent 
the burrows of some small creature.

Branches lace together in places, almost forming webs of their own.  
Tiny mushrooms peek out from the grass below.

Trees grow in natural profusion, smaller saplings mixed in with great 
old patriarchs of the forest.  Wildlife moves busily through the trees 
on its own business.  Squirrels collect nuts, while birds peck at pinecones. 
Everything seems peaceful and serene here.

Trees are clustered thickly, and vision is limited.  A lone squirrel 
chats at a blue jay far up in a tree. Pine needles carpet the ground
thickly.  The scents of untamed nature are strong all around.

A lightning struck tree is split cleanly down the middle.  The two

to respect the split tree's space.  Tangled undergrowth thrives at 
the base of the trees.
