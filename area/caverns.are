whistles through the air as it slices towards your neck.

Heading towards the Mountain~
~
A wide very worn path leads off to the west towards a dark and haunting
mountain. There are many large boulders scattered about, which could 
make it easy for an entire army to hide within the feild without anyone 
noticing. Gysers of steam spew gasous smoke into the air making visability 
very difficult for anyone except maybe a orc.

Heading towards the Mountain~
~
A dark and ominous mountain towers high above its peaks covered and
hidden by haze and clouds. Steep and jagged spires jutting towards
the heavens. The path heading towards the mountain has been crushed 
into fine powder by countless crossing.

Under the Arch~
~
Two hugh columns of course rough stone that are heavily scratched and
marred support a single piece arch of blood red stone. large boulders 
are stacked up around the base of the columns, but still allow for 
protection to those behind it. A extremely large cave opening can be
seen off to the Northwest.

The Mouth of the Cave~
~
The ceiling of the cavern looms high over head, the width of the cavern is 
well suited for staging an entire army within. This Cavern was cleverly 
constructed to allow for cover during an outside assault. The cavern 
narrows greatly as you go downwards to prevent the passage of a large 
force at any one time. The Mouth of the cavern is shaded and sloped giving 
a very strong advantage to those coming out of the cavern.

Finding the floor of the tunnel to be very slippery you use the jagged 
suface of the walls and ceiling for hand holds. An odd smell seems to
be coming from below, mixed with slight sounds of motion.

Guard post~
~
A small worn desk resides in the center of the room covered with papers 
and files with a small but comfortable chair behind it. A weapons rack is
tucked in the far corner with many harsh and brutal weapons inside it.
This office would only be given to a guard of very high distinction.

A massive fire pit is the center of attention in the room casting its 
fiery shadows across the cracks and crevasses of the black and 
silvery walls. The ceiling has been blackened from decades of fire.
At the center of the back wall a rough throne has been chiseled 
out of the rock. To the left two large iron rings have been fitted 
into the wall no doubt for chaining up someone's wrists.

A Prison Cell~

The occupant of this cell has long since past away, but the merciless king
deemed that his suffering was not long enough for his tastes and has cast
a spell to hold the prisoners soul here until he thought his suffering was 
enough. Strange runes one the ground around the prisoner chained to the
wall are an constant reminder of the kings wicked spell.

The orc's Den~
~
In the center of a high dome shaped ceiling a chain-link chandalier hangs,
rocking back and fourth caused by the light movements of the mountain.
The walls have been left very rough for design, On the back wall, artistians
have used different colored rocks and stones to form a murial of  two of
their own kind locked in combat with each other flying high above the earth.

Walking Below the Arches of KrinMar the ominous feeling of  ancient power
and great evil weighs heavily upon the soul. The Arches are stained deep with
the cold dried red blood of thousand upon thousands of victims of the Horde.

the very drop of innocent blood finds its way here.
