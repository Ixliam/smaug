Manacles line the walls, some with skeletons still occupying them. Tiny 
little portholes line the walls above the manacles. You find yourself 
feeling very sorry for the poor slaves who were chained in here.

lining the wall. Here the slaves spent their last minutes. You can only

Despite the illegality of slavery, you are amazed at the number of slaves 
they must have stuffed into this area. Most were chained to the walls, 
some apparently were left unchained. Now all that remains of them are bare 
bones.  A few rotting planks are along the walls.

You feel a moment of pity for the poor wretches who died here. You wonder 
what crimes they may have committed to be locked in chains in the aft hold 
of the ship. Or were they helpless victims, stolen from their homes and 
families?  There are rotted away planks along the walls.

Shackles hang from the walls, leaving you in no doubt that the former

gnarled sycamore tree branch~
Looking at the branches over your head, you realise that they may
provide your only way out of the river. If you can just CLAMBER up
onto that branch, you may survive...

In the Waterfall~
~
You slide irresistibly over the edge of the waterfall, landing with a
great KERPLASH! amongst several sharp rocks.  Your boat breaks into
a thousand sharp, tiny pieces, each of which whirls first away and then
back on unpredictable eddies.  You drift back under the falling water,
and are borne to the floor, smashing against the rocky bottom.  You 
feel bones snap before you are spat back up, rising several feet above 
the water's surface before falling back.. right on top of one of the 
largest, jaggedest rocks you have ever seen.  You feel sharp teeth on 
your toes as your consciousness fades.

On the Sandy Beach~
~
&OThe water here is dark and murky, the smell atrocious. You can see what
might be an island not too far distant, but to get there would require
going through water even nastier looking than this. You find yourself
wondering what made such a mess of the ocean.

Clinging to a Branch~
~
Looking down, you breathe a sigh of relief to have made it safely
out of the river. Below you, you watch as your boat goes over the
waterfall, smashing to pieces on the rocks. Had you not climbed
out, that would be you on the rocks below. Not a pleasant thought.
For a moment, you wonder what it would be like to dare the elements
and JUMP into the waterfall, but sanity quickly reasserts itself, and
you choose instead to climb along the branch and down the tree to the
relative safety of the island.

The Eye of the Giant Whirlpool~
~
You find yourself suddenly in a quiet, totally still spot on the ocean,
in the very eye of the storm. In every direction, titanic forces of
nature battle to assert their dominance over the sea. Yet here, in the eye,
all is still. The water itself is almost glassily clear, and as you look
down, you realise that underneath the water is a sunken ship. The ship
appears to be sitting perfectly upright on the floor of the ocean, in 
nearly pristine condition. Nothing seems to mar its beauty.

Under the River~
~
You can barely see through the dark, murky water. You swim down,
trying to avoid the worst of the garbage in the water. In a brief
lucid moment, you wonder what possessed you to come this way,
but you merely shrug and continue on. Up close, you can see
that the carnage in the water is widely varied. Some of the 
refuse is human. A bit over there seems to be from a shark, and
that clearly used to be the claw of a dragon..

You find yourself in an underground branch of the river, as a

to the relative safety of the world above.

The underground river suddenly widens out into an underground
lake, and you find yourself in what seems to be an immense
water filled cavern. You can only assume from the amount of
waste in the water that whatever is responsible lives down
here somewhere. You once more consider returning to the safety 
of the world above.

You experience a moment of panic as you move away from your
exit to the safety of the world above. You sternly tell yourself
to relax. Surely you have nothing to fear down here? You wonder
why you don't feel as certain of that as you should. A sudden 
movement in the water catches yor attention, but whatever that
was is gone before you can tell what moved.

You move cautiously in the darkness under the water. Barely
able to see your way, with the water slowing your movements,
you have no choice but to go slowly. Bits and pieces of things
you don't want to think about float by you, brushing against
you, and you find yourself wondering where the cause of this
mess could be.

In the Lair~

The floor slopes up sharply here, and your head soon breaks out 
from under the water. You find yourself wishing you had stayed
underwater. It seems that the creatures out in the cavern were
only the young. And compared to their mother, they were also
very neat eaters. The island here in this underground cavern
seems made more of bodies than ground..

Under the Waterfall~

The waterfall cascades down into this large hidden
cavern. It seems you are, indeed, under the waterfall.
Unfortunately, the Captain's log did not mention anything
about a guardian of the treasure.. Although *you* could
not get out that way, you assume the mare can use
Kelpie magic to get out through the waterfall. Alas,
knowing that still doesn't tell you how to get past
the mare to the treasure..

Along the Main Mast~

Looking down, you can see the ship spread out below you. It seems almost 
as if it is cradled in a giant rocky hand. From up here, you can clearly 
see three fingers on one side of the ship, and what could be a thumb along 
the other side. As you get closer, you also realise the ship isn't in as 
pristine condition as you thought.

Working your way past tattered fragments of what were once the sails, you 
pause to gaze down at the ship. Despite having been underwater for who

the wood of the main deck seems to shine, and the brass railings gleam as 
if recently polished.

You breathe a sigh of relief, having finally broken

see land. You could explore the ocean more, or return
to the relative safety of the land. The storm waits at
your back.

A Tiny Hidden Graveyard~
~
A small clearing lies at the end of an almost invisible trail, hidden from view
from above. The clearing is carpeted with thick lush green grass, an anomoly in
this place. Wildflowers abound in profusion, and a small brook trickles toward
the river, babbling quietly to itself. Three mounds lie within the clearing. A
haunting melody teases at your mind, barely audible yet teasing your senses.

brook~
As your attention focuses more closely on the brook running thru the clearing,
you realise that along with its babbling it is the source of the melody you can
barely hear. Focusing closer, you can even make out the words..
&wYou and I, moving in the dark, bodies close but souls apart.
Shattered smiles, secrets unrevealed. I need to know the way you feel.
And I'll give you everything I am, and everything I want to be.
I'll put it in your hands if you could open up to me.
Oh, can't we ever get beyond this wall?
Cuz all I want is just once to see you in the light,
but you hide behind the color of the night.
I can't go on, running from the past. Love has torn away this mask.
And now like clouds, like rain, I'm drowning, and I blame it all on you.
And I've lost, God save me.
And I'll give you everything I am, and everything I want to be.
I'll put it in your hands if you could open up to me.
Oh, can't we ever get beyond this wall?
Cuz all I want is just once to see you in the light,
But you hide behind the color of the night.
God save me. Everything I am, and everything I want to be,
oh, can't we ever get beyond this wall?
Cuz all I want is just once forever and again.
I'm waiting for you, I'm standing  in the light,
But you hide behind the color of the night.
Please come out from the color of the night.

Amazing that there should be a fully intact, indeed, extremely neat and

the cottage, or how she came to be a ghost, but something wise inside you 
warns you that some questions are far better left unasked.
