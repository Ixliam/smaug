Campfire Amongst Several Tents~
~
This wide clearing in the midst of the forest has been made into an 
encampment of sorts.  There is a large campfire with some pots hanging over 
it in the center, and a pile of cut wood next to it.  Some large kegs and 
piles of sacks sit nearby.  There are dark green tents all around.

A Path through the Camp~
~
Along the path here someone has set up a place to leave horses.  There is a 
wooden log to tether them to, and some buckets of grain and water.  The 
brush is extremely thick, but you can see a clearing to the south where a 
campfire is burning.

A Trodden Path~
~
The path runs east and west through the brush which has been roughly cleared 
to make a path.  You can see some dark tents to the south, and a larger tent 
in the distant north and the smell of smoke hangs in the air.

A Path through the Brush~
~
The path has been cleared turning to the north, where you can see a large 
tent has been pitched.  Further along to the west, you see other small 
encampments of tents, blending into the greens of the surrounding brush.

Before a Large Tent~
~
The path here leads up to a large tent with a closed flap.  A few guards 
wander about protectively, keeping watch.  The brush on either side of the 
path is dense, and cutting a path through it seems a little impossible.
