Deep in a Jungle~
~
The jungle is wild and primeval, with no hint of civilisation at all. This 
is truly a place for the adventurous, where wild animals roam and kill at 
will. The many trees around in the jungle are used by avian species as 
their home and safe haven. Some other animals use the bark of these trees 
as well for other purposes, such as camouflage. Many rotted leaves cover 
the ground, making crinkly noises when stepped on. All the animals in the 
jungle learn to listen for such noises, either to escape being eaten or to 
catch unwary prey.

Deep in a Jungle~
~
Home to many majestic beasts of prey, the jungle is lush with vegetation 
and teeming with life. Everything in the jungle follows the one rule - 
"Survival of the Fittest". There are many trees in the jungle, some barely 
a few feet high, while others loom tall in the sky. All of these trees 
however, be they big or small, are blooming with life. Many rotted leaves 
cover the ground, making crinkly noises when stepped on. All the animals 
in the jungle learn to listen for such noises, either to escape being 
eaten or to catch unwary prey.

Deep in a Jungle~
~
The jungle is wild and primeval, with no hint of civilisation at all. This 
is truly a place for the adventurous, where wild animals roam and kill at 
will. There are many trees in the jungle, some barely a few feet high, 
while others loom tall in the sky. All of these trees however, be they big 
or small, are blooming with life. The ground is uneven here, with tree 
roots and rocks poking out at odd intervals, ready to trip an unwary 
animal or person.

In Front of a Tall Tree~
~
Hot and humid, the jungle exists to remind people of a time when beasts 
ruled and stalked the earth. This is a dangerous place to be in for the 
unwary and foolish. There are many trees in the jungle, some barely a few 
feet high, while others loom tall in the sky. All of these trees however, 
be they big or small, are blooming with life. The ground is uneven here, 
with tree roots and rocks poking out at odd intervals, ready to trip an 
unwary animal or person. One of the trees look climbable here.

Inside a Rotted Log~
~
The insides of the log are full of creepy crawlies, such as spiders, 
toads, and unidentifyable black insects. It is nice and cozy inside the 
log though. Twin beams of light enter the log from the north and south 
entrances.

On the Branches of a Tall Tree~
~
There are many handholds and rough surfaces on the tree trunk, making this 
portion easy to ascend. There is a small hollow within the tree, with a 
sleepy owl nestled inside, oblivious to its surroundings. An elephant 
charges through the jungle below, with its tusks pointed in the direction 
of the pond.

On the Branches of a Tall Tree~
~
The thick branches and leaves are slippery with dew, making a climb 
upwards difficult. Down below, a tiger suddenly runs through the jungle, 
searching for prey to devour. Luckily, it doesn't bother looking up the 
tree. Dark storm clouds slowly gather at a distance ahead. It looks like 
it is about to rain soon.

At the Peak of a Tall Tree~
~
The top of the tree has many leafy branches, stretching out in the 
distance. Many birds of prey make their nests on them. A woodpecker 
eagerly drills holes in the tree trunk, helping to make handholds in the 
tree at the same time. The leaves suddenly flutter, and a colorful parrot 
peeks out hesitantly, before flying off in a fright. There is a vine 
dangling within the branches here.

Deep in a Jungle~
~
Home to many majestic beasts of prey, the jungle is lush with vegetation 
and teeming with life. Everything in the jungle follows the one rule - 
"Survival of the Fittest". The many trees around in the jungle are used by 
avian species as their home and safe haven. Some other animals use the 
bark of these trees as well for other purposes, such as camouflage. A foul 
smell emerges from the ground below, and the head of an animal carcass 
peeks through the soil, its blank souless eyes staring at the sky.
