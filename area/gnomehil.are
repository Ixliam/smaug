grey stone statue golem~
the stone golem~
A grey stone statue of a golem is here.
~
Before you rests a large stone golem on a pedastal which nearly touches the 
ceiling.  It is made to resemble armor around his body and a huge sword 
spans from his hands which he holds with both.  His eyes are a soft jade 
colour and on his forehead are many different symbols.  You can make out a 
flame, a bolt of lightning and what appears to be ice.  There are four other 
unrecogniseable ones.

a small wooden desk that sits in the corner of the shop.  The only exit is

Town Street~
~
You are standing in front of the gates of a tall palace structure.  The 
large gates are tall, and made of copper and iron.  The walls are of a slate 
grey stone, with veins of red running through it.  To the north, and to the 
south, small cobbled paths lead to an array of small gnome houses.

Small Cobbled Path~
~
You are at the fork of a small cobbled path.  Small gnome houses stand to 
the east, west, and north.  They are small, but quaint and well made, and 
look like a nice place to live.  They each have a small garden, with strange 
but beautiful plants in them.  The path leads to the south, towards a large 
palace like structure.

The Entrance to the Mine~
~
You are standing in the opening of a cave.  To the north, a large crack in 
the rock yawns in the darkness.  You can see lights in the darkness.  At the 
edge of the crack, a steel ladder has been attached, that goes down into the 
darkness.  Light shines in from the open end of the cave, to the south.  A 
large system of wheels and cogs, attached to a crank, runs a wire frist up 
to a suspended wheel attached to the ceiling.

A long shaft, with a ladder.~
~
You are climbing down a long dark shaft.  The metal ladder, makes it easy to 
climb, and torches have been jammed into the walls, in a line leading down.  
This dark shaft is very long, for you cannot see the top nor the bottom.  
Two long cables extend up and down in the darkness.

A Large Cavern~
~
You are standing in a large cavern.  The floor here has been leveled, and a 
square field of fungus grows here.  In the north corner of this cavern, a 
metal ladder leads up to a large crack in the ceiling.  Two thick metal 
wires extend down out of the crack, attached to a large wooden platform that 
hangs a few inches off the ground.  Here and there, on the distant walls of 
the caverns, torches shed a dim light.  The ceiling is too high even to see. 
 Three large tunnels, with a line of torches extends to the east, north, and 
west.

A Dead End~
~
You are standing at the end of a tunnel.  It opens up a bit here, and the 
end wall is mainly rubble.  A small vein of gold shimmers here, obviously 
the gnomes decided it was not worth the bother of all the miners, to mine 
the gold here.  Two large torches illuminate the small space.  The only exit 
is the tunnel that extends to the south.

shaggy carpet, and spruce baseboards.  Windows line the east wall.  There is 
a door to the south.

window ~
You are looking out over the gnome village.  To the north, you can see the 
tall, elegant bell tower, of the quaint church, between the various plain 
buildings of the village.  To the east, you can barely make out a strange, 
mosh-posh building, with a large flat area on it's roof.  To the north west, 
you can see a large, stubby cylinder shaped building.  At the edge of your 
vision east, and west you can see large mountains, that form the valley that 
the gnome village is neslted in.

picture painting small~
This painting depicts a young gnome adorned in fine white clothing awell as 
red clothing.  He holds a white cylinder staff in one hand and and a small 
stone in the other.  His attire cosists of both red and white items.  Power 
illuminates through this picture and slowly you see the young gnome age into 
a much older and withered gnome.  The sense of power still exists.

~
This large office looks important.  It is well kept and spacious.  The desk 
and chairs are set up, with one behind it, and two in front.  The walls are 
filled with different papers, pinned up at random, each of them looks like 
an important civil document.  There is a door to the east.  Also, there is a 
`Ylarge crest`x on the west wall, above the desk.

large crest~
This large icy blue crest, looks very important.  This crest depicts a grey 
sparrow, it's arms open wide, and in it's claws a horizontal golden dagger.  
On the four corners of this shield, there is a small grey symbol, depicting 
the 4 great guilds of the gnomes.  A dagger for the Mage's guild, a minning 
pick for the Miner's Guild, a metal cog for the Inventor's Guild, and 
finally a Hammer, for the Clerics of Knor.  Under the crest, it says " Civil 
Affairs, Gnome Hill."

A Hall~
~
This wooden hall is quite grand.  The hall is wide, and the floor made of 
stone.  Along the floor and across the walls are large grooves, and 
scratches, as if something large and heavy has been moved through the hall.  
Doors stand to the south, and in every other direction a hall leads away.

South End of the Testing Range~
~
This is an open grassy field, with walls to the east and south, and a 
building to the north.  The field continues north, and there is an open door 
to the east.  There are some mud puddles here and there, but mostly the 
grass is thick and soft.  There is one large crater, pretty large and black 
too.

North End of the Testing Range~

This is a small grassy area, with a wall to the east, and more fields to the 
south.  The north wall is a sheer cliff, and large chunks have been ripped 
out of it, leaving chunks in the face of it.  At the base of the cliff is a 
large pile of blackened rubble.

The Machine Shop~
~
This large room is filled with `#`mn`ro`mi`rs`me`^!  The wooden floor is covered in 
sawdust and metal filings, and the windows are clouded with dust and soot.  
On the east side of the room seems to be some sort of furnace and kiln.  All 
around the room are tables with strange gnomish devices.  Strange indeed.  
There is hall to the west.

The Landing Pad~
~
This appears to be a part of the roof in this building.  It is cleared, and 
smoothed with stone tiles.  It is wide and square.  There is an archway in 
the west wall.  In every other direction, is the edge of the roof.  There is 
a large "L" painted on the floor.  Towering above you to the west appears to 
be a large tower with two domes at the top of it.  To the east is a small 
building which looks odd, because of the strange accordian-like device 
sticking out of it's side.

This room is a large dome, the walls and floors are painted black.  The room 
is very dark, except the ceiling which is covered in points of light, 
emulating the night sky.  The points seem to be placed at random, although 
there are some patterns.

black.  There is an archway to the west.

Magi's Road~
~
You are standing on a small road.  The most specatacular thing, is the 
building to the north where a tall tower stands, it's stone a smooth red 
umber.  The doors and window frames are made of a dark, solid black oak.  At 
the base of the tower is a small wall made of stone.  Two large solid black 
oak doors stand slightly open, directly to the north.  The wall surrounds 
the tower, but is too low to provide any real defense.  The road leads 
directly to the base of the tower, through the gates.
