Selvetarm~
Selvetarm, Prince of the Aranea~
Selvetarm, Prince of the Aranea sits here watching over his throne room.
~
An aura of immense confidence and fearlessness surrounds him, jet-black 
skin shimmering slightly as though moonlit, complimenting the silvery hair 
that cascades down his back. Bloodlust burns in his fierce eyes, like 
burning coals they glow vaguely red, casting his regal features in an 
eerie crimson hue.

A magnificent orb spider~
A magnificent orb spider spins its web here.
~
This large regal looking spider has striking scarlet patterning all over 
its bulging round body. Delicate, long legs look far too fragile to 
support it but its movements are quick and elegant. Blackberry clusters of 
gleaming eyes watch the entrance way without let up, seeing through cloaks 
of darkness and magic alike.

the scaly leviathan~
A scaly leviathan's monstrous head protrudes from the water.
~
Sharp serrated teeth frame the open massive jaw of this creature. Two tiny 
black eyes peer out from the scale armour of its gigantic face. Deep below 
the water, the enormous undulating shadow of its body sends waves rippling 
across the surface.

The Lizard King~
An enormously tall lizard man lounges on the throne.
~
Unusually tall, this reptilian humanoid is covered from head to toe in 
magnificent flecked green scales. His long sweeping tail flicks restlessly 
from side to side, and his cruel black eyes seem extraordinarily 
intelligent.

A hairy spider~
A hairy spider~
A hairy spider darts about the swamp
~
This vicious, black, hunting spider is most often found in jungles and 
caverns, though the damp of the swampland is equally acceptable as long as 
there is food to be found. Incredibly large, effective eyes ensure that 
even the dark cannot serve as a hiding place from this predator.

A bolas spider~
A bolas spider scuttles around here looking for prey
~
The air seems vaguely foggy around this creature, a powerful almost 
hypnotising scent wafting around it. The natural pheremones of this animal 
are apparantly as deadly as they are intoxicating, judging by the 
predatory gleam in its calculating eyes.

A funnel spider~
A funnel spider spins its web absentmindedly
~
This spider keeps as much of its body shrouded in darkness as it can. 
Enormously large, vulnerable looking eyes peer cautiously about, so keenly 
able in the dark, this spider is probably all but blind in sunlight.

A wasp spider~
A wasp spider lurks here, sticky ooze coating its forelegs.
~
This smallish spider has a subtly striped hide, and a constant stream of 
sticky web-like substance that it coats its legs with, particularly useful 
for capturing and entangling unobservant prey.

trapdoor spider~
A trapdoor spider~
A trapdoor spider crouches, attempting to hide itself.
~
This stealthy spider gets its name from its love of hiding places and 
attacking its prey with a quick ambush. Dark shades of drab colours, its 
relatively small body is easy to conceal, only the glint of its smooth 
fangs and dark eyes easily betray its presence.

The man, of a very old age, has a sickly look about himself. He lays 
moaning in what seems like a pain that no man would want to experience, 
the rags of what he calls cloths are good for nothing but hiding his most 
private of areas.

This massive spider is almost ten feet in width, long jointed legs 
clicking slightly as they support the weight of its huge bulbousy black 
body. The two signature grey stripes of the whisper species mark this 
creature's underbelly, and two blood red eyes peer effortlessly through 
the dark.

with solid oak and the soft green shag carpet flows around the floor.  A large

black leather computer chair with a hard plastic cover on carpet so that the

powerful magic in this area.

Within the Roots~

this place even more miserable. The floor slants slightly downward to the

Hollow Trunk~
~
&gMud oozes slowly through cracks in the ancient wood, making the ground 
sticky and treacherously slippery. The roof of the trunk curves sharply 
around, so low as to give the place a smothering claustrophobic feel. 
Little worms and maggots wriggle their way through the decomposing bark, 
making the enclosure seem to crawl revoltingly.

Circle of Trees~
~
&gA patch of red flashes in and out of vision through the thick dark 
cluster of trunks. The beautiful crimson leaves of a black gum tree seem 
almost to light the area as a burning fire illuminates night.&w

Circle of Trees~
~
&gTall dark trunks emerge from the sloshing mud, fragile and crooked with 
age, slimy swamp algae covering them with slick green ooze. Spindly 
desperate branches grasp blindly at the air like the skeletal fingers of 
some long buried giant.&w

Opening in a Circle of Trees~
~
&gAll around, the ancient and brittle bark of dying trees is all that can 
be seen. The odd green shoot of a struggling youngster coloring the 
gloominess, and the scent of new plant life freshening the air, even as 
fungi consume the rotting elders.

Straggling Trees~
~
&gWeak bending trunks support the anemic looking branches and leaves of 
these stunted willows. Swaying miserably in the slight breeze, their bark 
seems to creak and groan, swamp moss spreading slowly as if to consume 
them. Thin grasses lean pathetically against the lanky trunks, almost like 
weary children clinging to their mothers.&w

Bend in an Ancient road~
~
&gWater sloshes noisily down this path which slopes downward to the west, 
coated slightly with the glassy sheen of an inch or two of clear running 
water. The carefully laid mosaic stones and colored glass can clearly be 
seen.

A Cozy Hut~
~
&gSome sort of underground heat seems to warm this little hut, the cracked 
stone floor feeling slightly warm to the touch. Bundles of hollow reeds 
have been used to create small tables, upon which dried grasses and leaves 
are heaped like bedding.&w

A Place of Meeting~
~
&gA small campfire flickers lazily in this paved circular area. Several 
smooth rocks are placed strategically all around the center as if making 
up some sort of seating. Beside the fire, a crude wooden platform has been 
erected.&w

A Wooden Shelter~
~
&gSeveral dead branches have been roped together with vines to make this small
shelter.  Several reeds and grasses have been used to patch up the gaps, and the
whole structure has been coated with a layer of mud.&w

A Large Hut~

&gA huge straw mat covers the ground here, decorated with various tribal 
paints to display images of royalty and wealth. Gold and silver glint here 
and there like stars in the dark clay walls, and a large cushioned chair 
sits against the eastern wall.&w

A Trophy Room~
~
&gFlickering fire illuminates the room from a high wooden shelf. Dancing 
shadows creep along the lower shelves which hold a variety of humanoid and 
animal skulls. Small piles of teeth and claws sprinkle the perimeter of 
the floor, and it can only be assumed that these trophies are all that 
remain of past enemies.&w

A drowned Path~
~
&gClear water runs here as several surrounding streams trickle into this 
large pool. Dirt and grit settle slowly at the bottom, covering partially 
what appear to be the carefully set slate tiles of an ancient road running 
north and south.&w

Circle of Trees~

&gThe mud here is dangerously sticky, only the buried weaving roots of the 
surrounding trees acting as footholds. It seems as though the brittle wood 
moans gently, complaining at the cruelty of the wind, restless breezes 
scurrying here and there as though being chased.&w

Circle of Trees~

&gThe great shell of a long dead cypress tree stands here, mighty branches 
creating a skeletal leafless canopy. The persistent creep of swamp vines 
and moss nearly coat the entire trunk, as though the bog were trying to 
reclaim it.

&gThe fluttering of wings disturbs the still air every now and again, 
while the mournful screeching of crows can be heard from the swaying 
above. Most of the trees here are dead, only one or two trailing green 
branches with leaves into the watery surroundings.

Place of Worship~
~
&gA small trail of crushed bones mingles with the broken twigs and 
branches carpeting the floor. A massive stone altar stands within a small 
clearing here, enclosed within the trunks of the surrounding trees. A 
smoking fire lingers here, some burned carcass giving off the smell of 
cooked flesh. Before the altar, a large metal grid is embedded into the 
ground.&w

A Dank Prison~
~
&gThe walls drip mournfully with muddy water that trickles slowly from the 
ceiling grid. A large sacrificial slab stands in the center of the room, 
covered with gruesome stains. Various metal instruments hang from the 
walls, along with the well-used chains of past unfortunate prisoners 
here.&w
