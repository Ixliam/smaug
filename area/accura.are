The entrance of this cave is a rather large hole in the ground.  The
trees surrounding the entrance seem to have been pushed aside almost
as if something large had walked into the cave, and needed the extra 
room.  As the cave is examined a little closer it is noticed that 
possibly something might have created this hole.

Walking in the Tunnels~
~
Marks litter the surface of this floor going in as many directions as
there are exits out of this room.  The ceiling, as well as the walls
are smooth to the touch as if carved purposefully.

The tunnels in this room travel at a slightly downward direction as
if the creator was purposefully heading in a downward direction. The

Dusty Bones~

Bones are seen against the westward walls of this room.  Many different
bones sit here of animals that are in piles, and seem to be mixed together.
Rather small claws are seen mixed within the piles of bones.

Streaming Along~

through a small crack at the base of the wall.  Claw marks also seem
to disappear into this strange crack.

Traversing the Tunnels~

The walls of this room just as the others have been cleanly carved 
and has left no rough stones.  Large marks on the floor appear to
perhaps be equally large claw marks.  The direction of travel is 
undeterminable because of the various sets of tracks.

Courbin's Chambers~
~
Standing near the back of this remarkably large room is a rather large
desk to go with the size of the room.  Sitting behind this desk is
the mayor of Accura.  Piles and piles of papers litter the top of this
desk, and also part of the floor having long run over the over sized
desk.  The mayor seems to only barely notice an intrusion of his peace.

Lost but never forgotten ~

Trees tall as the eye can see cover the grounds within this room.  Roses
of all shapes and colors are also very visible at the roots of the trees
blending in perfectly with the trees.  A play house sits unused in the middle
of all the growth.  Ivy having almost completely covered the never used play
house covers almost the entire thing.  Toys litter the floor of the playhouse
never having the pleasure of being used
