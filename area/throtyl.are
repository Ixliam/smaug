a frazzled looking drow mage~
A frazzled looking drow mage in long dusty robes.
~
This still-young drow is obviously new at his task.  He is running around 
from shelf to shelf looking for potions and scrolls.  His robes are dusty 
from his efforts and his long black hair continually falls over his too-thin 
face.  Despite his youth however, he is amazingly adept at his task and 
clearly knowledgeable in the ways of magic.  Confidence shines in his dark 
eyes and a slight sneer mars his face.  It is the sneer of someone who knows 
he is in charge and feels slightly superior.

This scimitar curves slightly from the blade, and the metal has the 
appearance of some sort of obsidian glass-like metal.  The extraordinary 
thing about the blade is the fact that it is engulfed in flames, yet the 
fire on the blade seems nothing more than an illusion.  The hilt of the 
sword is wrapped in black leather and a reddish gem glimmers on the bottom 
of the hilt.

27044 table ~
Dominating the dusty attic is a massive study table made of thick oak.  A 
dark mahogany in colour it must have once been beautiful but now the 
burnished sheen of the wood has faded and it is mottled with ink stains and 
sulpher burns.  Crumpled bits of parchment paper are crumpled around the 
table obviously remnants of whatever work was done on the table itself, also 
filled almost to its brim with parchment, bottles of ink, used quills and 
various books.

27185 scimitar frozen dreams~
This scimitar curves slightly from the blade, and the metal has the 
appearance of some sort of obsidian glass-like metal.  The extraordinary 
thing about the blade is the fact that it is engulfed in ice crystals, yet 
the cold on the blade seems nothing more than an illusion.  The hilt of the 
sword is wrapped in black leather and a azure gem glimmers on the bottom of 
the hilt.

scorched black, but from what you cannot tell.  Streets lead in all four

Gems n Stuff~
~
This shop is not too badly appointed when compared to the rest of the
dumps surrounding it.  There are some tapestries on the wall, and even a few
showcases.  The cases are locked with huge padlocks, and have extremely
thick glass, maybe this is a high crime area.  There are also a few shelves
loaded with books and scrolls.  The only exit is east.

Bank of Throtyl~
~
This place is built with security in mind, from the looks of it.  There
is only one exit to the west, and along the east wall a counter, which
is protected by thick steel bars.  Behind the bars are the bank tellers,
who will help you store your money and hopefully only embezzle a small
amount of each deposit if you're lucky.

Chaotica~
~
This small temple appears to be dedicated not to any god, but to chaos 
itself.  The walls are covered with arcane writings, as well as murals and 
drawings of orcs, gnolls, kobolds, and humans engaging in bizarre rituals in 
which they sacrifice their own blood and body parts.  There is a black altar 
in the front of the room, upon which stands several bowls of blood, ready 
for some evil ceremony.  The only exit is to the east.

The Pestilence Pit Inn~
~
The common room of this inn is a mess.  All the furniture and tables seem to 
have been been broken and cobbled back together many times, undoubtedly from 
drunken bar brawls.  The floor is very sticky from spilled drinks and food, 
and there are some glass shards here and there that no one has bothered to 
clean up.  The bar itself is along the south wall, and looks at least like 
someone has wiped it off some time in the near past.  There is a doorway to 
common room to the north, a narrow staircase leading down, and a hallway 
goes north to some guest rooms.  The exit to the street is south.

Common Room~
~
This small back room has a stone fireplace, and some furniture that seems to 
be a bit nicer and in better condition than that in the common room.  It has 
its own small bar, and seems to be a more private place where some of the 
more wealthy patrons can come to gamble, play games, or hold important or 
secret meetings.  A staircase leads up to the guest rooms, and the inn 
entrance is to the south.

This building is a chaotic mess.  Magic-users of all races are scattered
around the place practicing spells on themselves and on each other, often
with spectacular results.  You can even see a few piles of ashes lying
on charred spots on the floor where a few have backfired.  This certainly
seems to be the center for magic in this town.  There even appear to be a
few things for sale.  The only exit is south.

Carriage Station~
~
Stables filled with horses surround this area, as well as carriages lying 
around in rows.  The smell of unkept stables fill the area, with its horrid 
smell, its repulsing scent acrid in the air.  To the north lies a small 
wooden building and a sign hangs off of it beside its entrance.

Small Dirty Office~
~
Bookshelves line all across the walls, the air is filled with a dust, and 
body odor.  At the northern end of the office, there's a small wooden desk 
and a few chairs sitting around it.  You can hear horses neighing in the 
distance and the sounds of carriages returning from their trips out.

You are inside a small wooden carriage, velvet seats line all four corners 
of it and its small wooden door sits clamped shut on its left side.  One

Muhkck Road ~

scattered across the road that have deep cuts where carts have ridden.  To

front.

Boats and Bait~
~
Strewn about this large shack are several boats and canoes, and a few 
roughly-built rafts constructed from logs and sticks.  On the counter are 
jars of squirming worms.  A half-orc peers at you with one eye, and every so 
often shakes a jar of worms, just for fun.

A Darkened Barracks~
~
Old, wooden bunkbeds line the stark walls of this darkened room. Several low 
burning torches provide what little light there is. In one corner near the 
exit to the busy street, some gnoll soldiers sit at a table playing a game 
of cards. Now and again they break up the game and start argueing with one 
another.

The Seer's Chamber~
~
The room is cramped and dimly lit, almost shabby in appearance.  Tattered 
blue curtains sway to the gusty wind and from the tassles on the front 
entrance you can see the bustling crowd and busy street.  Scented candles 
hand on tiny holders on the walls and the strong smell of incense fills the 
room.  To the far end of the room a heavy velvet curtain of midnight blue 
covers what seems like a tiny entrance.  Bright yellow stars and half moons 
are roughly sewn on the cloth, an almost gaudy tribute to the world of 
magic.  A large handcrafted wooden `#`ysign`^ hangs on one wall.  It is surrounded 
by candles and looks a bit singed from the dripping wax.

tome ~
`yThe tome is filled with delicate yellowed paper. The pages are crumpled and burned as if wet by rain and burned by a great fire. The ink has run through and the words that are left are a mere jumble of letters. A title is embossed in ancient elven script on the stained leather cover. Though the tome is so old it seems about to fall apart the words still glow with enchantment:

Honest Nick's Pawn Shop~
~
This small shop is crowded with wares, all of them behind glass or metal. A 
small window, too dirty to actually see through, lets just enough light in 
so that you can see how remarkably dusty this shop is. A counter, placed 
about half way into the shop, has either been put there to serve customers 
or to prevent you from going deeper into the shop. Or both.

A Shadowed Corridor~

Bathed in shadows, this narrow corridor opens to the street its southern 
exit and leads deeper into shadows to the north. The air is quiet and all 
sounds are strangely muted. In width, it spans perhaps four or five feet but 
the shadows deepen against the walls making it difficult for you to be sure.

A Shabby Wagon~
~
Climbing a set of rickety stairs, you find yourself at the back door of a 
shabby wagon. At one time it was painting with gaudy colours of red, gold 
and silver, but the paint and words have long since faded leaving only the 
barest suggestions of their original design. On each side of the door is a 
window, the glass long since smashed from the frames.

Inside a Shabby Wagon~
~
The interior walls of this wagon are made of a roughly hewn, unfinished 
wooden planks. Some wooden boxes have been arranged around a larger wooden 
crate making a table of sorts. Two small windows border the door to the 
north, both of them covered with rags that serve to keep out prying eyes but 
still allow a bit of light to filter inside.

A Dark Chapel~

This large hall has is dark and unaturally cold.  Long black velvet curtains 
line the four sides of the hall, not letting in a single light from outside. 
 Looking up at the high domed ceiling, you notice a single glowing dark red 
orb, bathing the large hall in an eerie red glow.  There are four large 
circular columns at each corner of the hall.  The floor is deep blood red 
marbled and polished to a mirror finish.

giving the hall a dark, claustophobic air.  Some heavy wrought iron chairs 
are pushed against a round table on the left side of the hall.  A large 
bookshelf filled with tomes and books of religious and theoretical manuals 
line the south wall of the room.  A large black marble `#`ssign`^ hangs 
prominantly on the west wall.  A large blue orb hovers above, lighting the 
room with a dark gloomy blue light.  The floor tiled with polished black 
marble slabs.

removing the scales from a fish.

furnace burns along one side, puffing clouds of grey smoke through a chimney 
to the sky above.  A lanky lizardman is the coppersmith here, and noticing 
you, he stops for a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow, before 
continuing to hammer.

The Trellis~
~
This restaurant is in a vineyard.  A latticed overhead trellis covers the 
whole area, with grape vines creeping all around it.  In a corner of the 
vineyard, a beautiful elven bard sings to the tinkling of a grand piano and 
the sad sounds of a violin.  A slight breeze wafts through the vineyard, 
making the luscious grapes hanging from the overhead trellis to sway 
slightly, almost in time with the song.  The restaurant holds about 10 
tables, and it is about half filled now with diners.  Waitresses dressed in 
a black uniform and a frilly apron moves unobstructively amongst the tables, 
taking orders and refilling wine glasses.  A waitress walks towards you and 
shows you to an empty table.

have been set up in the darkest corners of the room.  Around them sit some 
of the locals, disguised in heavy cloaks, all speaking in hushed voices.

Yardoli's Tabacco Supplies~
~
You enter a smoke-filled building, and see racks of many types of pipes and 
pipeweed.  Some pipes have been delicately carved, others crudely shaped 
into something that barely resembles a pipe.  A gnollish man is serving 
customers, inbetween taking a puff of his pipe.

Mysteries of Magic~
~
Inside this crudely constructed shack, you see shelves displaying dusty old 
books, and scrolls rolled up tightly and sealed with wax.  A mysterious drow 
moves in and out of the shadows as customers peruse the shop.

Bodeebag Road~
~
This garbage covered street is a small back alley, barely wide enough for 
two people to walk side by side.  A small, roughly put together building has 
been constructed to the south, and there is sign hanging over the doorway.  
The alley continues to the east and west.

Hussat's Poisons and Potions~
~
This small, roughly constructed shack is dark, and the odours within almost 
make one's eyes water, they smell so bad.  There are no displays, and you 
wouldn't know what was for sale here, unless you asked the goblin eyeing 
your every move.

Cap in Hand ~
~
This cluttered shack has several crude displays of cheap cotton garments, 
and implements for cleaning and mining.  There is a large orc bossing a 
whimpering half-elf about, as he sits back and watches him do all the work.  
In coarse script, painted across the wall, are the words:`1`1 `#`S"Get that slave working - cheap mining picks for sale here!"  `^

Black Market~
~
Just off the road, a make-shift structure has been built from planks of 
unused wood and scraps of iron, blocking it off from surrounding buildings.  
This shady part of the town seems to be where the townfolk sell their 
"acquired" goods on the black market, for prices to steal for.

This crowded, junk-strewn shop sells a variety of items, all looking 
suspiciously cheap, as though there must be some flaw with them.  A short 
kobold eyes you up when you enter, ascertaining whether or not to approach 
you with some fine jewellery or shiny armor.

A Burnt-Out Shop~
~
Cracked windows, and grey-smoked walls are what's left of this shop.  
Vandals have looted most of what was left after the shop was set on fire, 
and there lie only piles of ashes with an occasional scrap of cloth peering 
through.  The wind blows through where the back wall used to be, where only 
a few bricks remain standing.  In the eastern wall, there is a large crack, 
perhaps where the shop safe once was.

the bed and a couple of windows.  The room is filled with dust that covers 
some areas so thick you can't even see the floor.  To the corner of the 
chest a scrap of parchment has been posted.
