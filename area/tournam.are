The Lists~
~
This area is known as the lists.  It is the area where the jousting
takes place.  It is closed off by means of a rope, which doesn't stop
spectators from wandering inside it occasionally.  Here the jousts take
place, usually of two opposing knights at a time, one from the `RRed
Rose`x and the other from the `WWhite Rose`x houses.  The lists continues
to the west and north, whereas the spectator area lies outside the rope.

The Wagering Tent~
~
This tent has been set up by a scoundrel known to everyone as 'Lying
Ed'.  Quite why he has got this nickname is unclear.  The tent is
relatively small and smells of stale beer and other unpleasant aromas. 
Scraps of paper lie tossed onto the ground and stubs of charcoal have
been ground into the earth.

Red Rose Stables~
~
These are the stables for the knights of the `RRed Rose`x.  All
knights who come to the tournament to joust on behalf on the `RRed Rose`x
can stable their mounts here.  The stables are filled with hay for the
horses and straw and wood shavings lie on the ground.  The grooms for
these stables are meticulous in their work, picking up manure and
cleaning out dirty straw regularly.

The Refreshment Tent~
~
This is the area of the tournament ground which seems to be in great
demand.  The refreshment tent is large and the ground well stamped down
from the milling around of the spectators who eagerly come here to sample
the ale and freshly baked bread, before they rush out to see the rest of
the contests.

A steep trail~
~
The path winds down this cliff erratically. Although steep, the path is not very difficult.  However, ahead of you is a white stag with golden horns. Just standing there, waiting.
