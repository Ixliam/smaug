squire Tianna~
Tianna Saleane~
A beautiful female squire is here to greet new arrivals.
~
This is a woman, that is obvious, yet she does not quite fit what you
are used to a female looking like.  You can not place what it is at
first.  As you look her over, you see she is tall and quite slim, and
her figure is one to attract eyes.  As you glance again over her face
you notice her face is quite white, almost brilliantly so.  Her eyes
are black as coal, no pupil distinguishable from the iris.  She smiles
as she watches your mind turn to take in her appearance, and that is
the last piece of missing information.  You notice the small fanged
eyeteeth, and realize this is a vampire standing before you.  What
world have you stepped into?

mage Erainne~
Erainne Ra'Kalanne~
The legendary mage of the Blood War is standing here.
~
This is a man who eyes speak volumes, mostly of knowledge and friendship.
Most dwarves are distrustful of strangers, but this one seems to thrive
on greeting and teaching the new travelers into these Realms.  His face
is covered in wrinkles, both from the sun and smiling.  His chin sprouts
a proud goatee, and his clothes are bright to the point of being gaudy.
His boots are a black leather, polished to a shine.  Overall, he makes
quite a striking picture.

A dragon hatchling peers at you, huge and darkly menacing.

The head of this dragon is identical to the one you viewed earlier, the
difference being that this one is (thankfully) only about tenth the size.
This dragon, though a baby, looks like a tough battle indeed.

Estae, the wandering boy~
Looking around curiously, a small boy with blond hair and bright amber eyes wanders about here.
~
Short and skinny, this energetic boy looks around fifteen years old. 
Bright amber eyes gaze inquisitively about him, alert and determined. Soft 
blond hair has feathery tufts flicking up and falls in messy bangs, coming 
down to his nape in the back. A strange jagged scar winds around his left 
wrist twice. He wears a white tunic that has a pair of small dragon wings 
attached, large black shorts with countless belts and pockets, and a pair 
of scuffed boots. He has a patched up satchel slung across his back and 
holds leather-bound book in one hand.

you should hold it and zap <target>.  Because this feather contains an attack

rope~
If you are ready to pass beyond the Spectral Gates, you need only pull this
rope to notify the Immortals that you are ready to enter the game!
 
If your name has been approved, you will be sent into the actual game.
 
If you receive a message stating your name has been denied by the Immortals,
you must choose a NEW, original medieval name.  To do this, you type:
 
"name <newname>"                 For example:  name Tsythia
 
Then pull the rope to announce your new name to the Immortals.  Give them
about 30 seconds to approve or deny the new name.  If you have not gotten
a response, pull the rope again.
 
The rope is on a 30 second timer, meaning you can pull it as often as you
wish, but the Immortals will only be notified once every 30 seconds.  The
Immortals are often busy and may not see you the first time around, so
please be patient - one will be with you as quickly as possible.

mirror~
You peer into the mirror. Its surface clouds over, and suddenly forms
a colourful image depicting a major battle in strange, far off lands..

Countless waves of green humanoids - goblins, orcs, trolls - are
assaulting a huge, heavily barricaded stone fortress. The green skins
are moving faster than the archers can reload, climbing over their
fallen comrades with war machines and ladders to breach the castle walls.

Suddenly, a massive meteor explodes in the centre of the horde, throwing
goblin limbs in the air and rendering the army asunder. Mages reinforce the
archers on the walls, and the drawbridge slowly opens to reveal legions of
hardened, steel clad warriors who set upon the remnants of the army with
vigor. It seems almost as if the battle has turned in the favour of the
castle army.

However, within mere minutes it's proved their last stand, and there is
still no end in sight to the green skinned horde who continue rampaging
and pillaging while they move through the town. Before the last stone falls,
a massive, dark figure can be seen striding through the horde, his voice
only a whisper yet carrying across the fields - Tanzean'al.

creatures from story books describing demons in Hell.  Only now you see a
large man dressed in black as he tears a hole in the air, creating a type
of gateway.  Now, you can hear them as well.  The demons shout for revenge!
The man in black sends the demons through the portal with a look of hate.
 
The image now fades away to another scene.  Here the demons are joined by the
evil Goblins and Orcs.  You recognize the place as the city Darva, or what
used to be the city Darva as the creatures pillage and destroy it.  The image
now disapears and you can see your reflection in the mirror.

page1 'Basic Rules'~
&G
1. MULTIPLAYING IS ALLOWED.  CODE WILL NOT PERMIT YOU TO ATTACK ANOTHER
PLAYER WITH MORE THAN ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS AT A TIME.

2. Keep all swearing in the [swear] channel. That's what it's for.
If you persist in ignoring this rule, expect to have your speaking
privileges revoked.

3. On a related note, no spamming public channels. As before, if
you are warned and do not stop, you will be silenced or worse.
* Do not ask questions on public channels without checking help
  files first.

4. Do not ask about staff commands, how MUDs work, or other such
behind-the-scenes stuff. We're not a MUD tutorial.

5. No advertising other muds here. Via channels, bios, html commands,
or anything.  If I even think you are, I will likely slay or destroy
you.  Repeated offenders will be banned.

~
E
page2 'Channel Rules'~
&G
Spam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.

Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
The swear channel should be utilized for profanity if you desire to do so.

If any level of STAFF asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  A STAFF's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.

Warning:  Arguing with or flaming STAFF on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.

~
E
page3 'Charm Rules'~
&G
Do not bring aggressive mobs into or near Homelands, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.

To turn page look page4
~
E
page4 'Cheating Rules'~
&G
Cheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.

What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or money
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or money
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or money -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using money that was accidentally duplicated
 - Killing mobs that are obviously too easy, and not set right for the
   experience that you gain.

Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform a STAFF member if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above.

If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to a STAFF member or drop and sacrifice the item.

~
E
page5 'Harassment Rules'~
&G
Harassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.

No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.

If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass a STAFF member, you will simply be deleted.

To turn page look page6
~
E
page6 'killsteal Rules'~
&G
Don't do it...

Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought.  This is both highly annoying and illegal.  If someone should do
this to you please inform them of the rules (ask them to read 'laws
killsteal').  If they continue, ask a STAFF member to intervene, if they
are not available to help though move away from that player and just
fight some place else.

To turn page look page7
~
E
page7 'Object Rules'~
&G
If you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present, or both players involved are
deadly.

Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.

Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
Unless both players involved are deadly.

Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing money from a corpse, unless both players involved are
deadly.

* Warning:  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.

E
page8 'PKILL Laws'~
&G
Warning :
Breaking a pkill law is not acceptable and brings severe penalty.

Law #1 Thou shalt not loot more then 3 items per corpse.
Law #2 Thou shalt not ask Staff for corpse retrievals.
Law #3 Staff may join clans, but will not hold the Clan Leader position.
Law #4 Staff found cheating, will loose their Staff status.
Law #5 Players found cheating, will be severely punished.

E
page9 'Sharing Rules'~
&G
Character sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  STAFF will not recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.

A character may not be shared if:
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order

To turn page look page10

E
page10 'Spam Rules'~
&G
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command

It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.

Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded,
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.

not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.

Any disputes brought to the attention of a STAFF member for resolution will be
handled according a STAFF member's discretion.  All such decisions are final.

page15 'Code Credits'~
&G
Where has all the Code for Six Dragons come from?

It has come from many sources.

The Head of Code council is Taon.
Volk, Remcon, and Vladaar have made code contributions over the years.
See 'news all'.

The Smaug Team developed the codebase that Orion Elder made a derivative
from.  I used Orion Elder's Chronicles Codebase.

A whole slew of snippets from other authors has been added to this mud
over the years, and at one point permission was attained to do so.

A great deal of code and snippets were taken from Garil of DotdII codebase,
and Samson of AFK codebase.  Both of these men have been instrumental in
helping this mud be what it is today.  Many thanks to all contributers.
My old friend Remcon has been a great help over the years.

If I have forgotten to give credit to someone please let me know, and I
will do so.

WHINE FREE MUD

Please refrain from whining in the mud on public channels, you can use
the global boards, and forums if you have a complaint. 

Whining not only brings morale down, it affects the attitudes and
game enjoyment of everyone.

Thanks for your understanding.

Seeing the Forest through the Trees~
~
The forest opens up a bit here, without actually giving of itself to field
or stream.  It is as if the forest were allowing you access to see the true
beauty that lies within.  Everything you had missed before, all the sights
and sounds and scents, all come to you now.  Your eyes alight upon a flock
of small purple birds which flutter and flow about the area.  A feathery,
light moss grows on the western side of the trees, giving off a faint,
musty smell, and small beetles work industriously in the moss, moulding it
into a haven from predators.  A gentle splashing sound causes your eyes to
drift northward, to a small pond.

The trees fall away here from the hill's edge, and jumbled rocks lie about
like forgotten toys left behind after a day's play.  Sharp edges and jagged
lines define the pathway as it wends its way upward.

Upon a Desolate Hillside~
~
Shattered and blasted stone litters the hillside here.  First glance gives
you the impression that this is the result of volcanic activity, but this
view is rapidly displaced as you gaze upon the ravaged bones strewn along
a section of the hill; a headless skeletal remains of a primitive beast.
The majesty of this huge, winged creature has not been diminished by its
boney state.  As you study the remains, you are amazed by the sheer size
of this beast, as he must have struck true fear into the hearts of those
who slew him.  Charred and shattered, hundreds of smaller bones splay
across the hillside, tangible proof that this great beast fought
fiercely before succumbing to its own death.

bone bones~
The bones here fit together to paint a vivid picture of a large battle -
man against beast.  The men took losses of their own before the beast was
defeated.  The bones of this creature appear to stretch a good twenty men
long, from neck-top to the tip of its tail, and you can imagine the size
of the missing skull.  Your mind wanders back to the reception area, to
the bust on the wall...

Cresting the Hill~
~
Burnt and dessicated ground gives way, grudgingly, to a grassy plateau.
Low hanging clouds obscure your view of the surrounding countryside, with
the only visible landmark being a tall tower to the southwest, piercing
through the clouds and disappearing skyward.  Pathways lead off down the
hillside to the east and west, and deep, intermittent rumblings come from
nearby.  Glancing southward you see the likely source - the dark opening
of a cave mouth.

Inside the Cavern~
~
Large and darkly shadowed, the uneven form of the walls makes it difficult
to determine the extent of this cave.  Strange shards litter the floor of
the cavern, and fresh marks gouged into the ground in and around these
shards help you to determine just what they are:  remnants of a recently
hatched egg of such enormous proportions the leathery pieces fill you with
a growing dread and caution.  Looking about with care, you easily discover
the skeletal remains of many humanoid creatures.  This barely has time to
register before a sharp rumbling causes you to look up suddenly.
