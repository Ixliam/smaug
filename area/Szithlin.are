In a Cave~
~
The path continues here, even as it plunges into the relative darkness of 
an opening in the rock face. Though the path is fairly well worn, the many 
layers of web seem to suggest that this cave houses more spiders than 
most, indicating that either a way of dealing with this "problem" has yet 
to be found, or that most of the travelers in the area don't really mind. 
The path drops steadily away from the mouth of the cave, burrowing deeper 
and deeper into the world.

In a Cave~
~
The last of the light filtering in from the outside world gives way to the 
ever-present night of the underground as the cave winds ever deeper. The 
spiders become all the more densely packed here, though they do not seem 
particularly interested in anything beyond the day-to-day aspects of their 
lives. Oddly enough, the musty smell which is often associated with caves 
seems to be absent from the air here, and a faint smell not entirely 
unlike that of a spring day wafts up from somewhere down below.

In a Cave~
~
Shadows cast by the light from the entrance to the cave can just barely be 
made out, shifting along the cold stone walls in a way reminiscent of 
childhood nightmares. The trail leads further down the steep incline, 
taking all who choose to follow it further and further from the surface 
world. Spiders flit about in the darkness on their tiny little legs, 
instinctively dodging the footfalls of passing travelers.

Nearing a Gate~
~
&OOne going down through the cave will now notice a large gate at the 
bottom of the steep decline, while someone going up might know that it 
leads to the entrance of the cave that they are in. The darkness seems to 
lighten up a bit here as cave nears the gate, as if to call weary 
travelers to it. Silhouettes of humanoid shapes can be seen moving about 
near the gate, but the light is very dim and proves to be misleading.

Entrance to Szithlin, the City of the Drow~
~
Two towers stand on either side of a large gate, black in the shadows of 
the underground, their ominous heights marking the main entrance to 
Szithlin, city of the Drow. Hundreds of feet below the surface, the only 
light here is given off by the few softly flickering torches that adorn 
the walls. A lone guard stands watch here, leering maliciously at 
anyone who dares demand his presence, and the occasional spider can be 
seen, shining with reflected light, as it scurries along the surface of 
the stone.

seems to be very clean and organized despite the lack of care in some 
parts of the cave. The roads are very neatly laid cobblestone with what 
appears to be a spider design inlaid within them every forty feet or so 
giving the roads a decorative look.

smaller then the rest of the graveyard. It rests alone off in a corner of

itself has seen quite a bit of vandalism over the years as no one really 
cares seeing as it is a symbol of dishonor in itself.

This is the second floor of the academy. One would notice that the 
students here seem a bit older then the ones on the first floor. This is 
where the more advanced classes take place. This area is a bit more quiet 
then the previous floor, seeing as the more advanced teachers require more 
discipline.

Blood and sand everywhere, the sounds of the crowd and battle fill the air 
that the blood cannot. People battle or people watch, there is never a 
dull moment in the great drow coliseum.

Sand drenched in blood, this ancient temple to that which is the art of 
battle stands tall and decorated with drow noble's and even those of 
lesser stature as everyone is welcome to share in carnage.

The crowd watches on as warriors fight for everything. Blood stains the 
sand in many places as well as a sword or some kind of broken armor laying 
near it forgotten in the haste of removing the bodies.
