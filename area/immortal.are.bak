A detachment of the `gs`Ge`gr`Gp`ge`Gn`gt `sa`Wr`smy`^ stands at the ready here. 
~
Before you stands a detachment of a army hoarde of numbers to large to even 
ponder counting. Trolls, orcs, and hobgoblins stand neatly in strict 
regiments with their hated human counterparts. Admist their masses large 
balista and catipults can be seen, great siege weapons both orc and human in 
nature. Their ranks seem to be neatly formed around large kennels full of 
thousands of dark skinned kobolds and goblins, war fodder. Great siege poles 
can be see rising high into the air in the midst of them, all bearing a red 
flag with the symbol of a `#`Yc`yro`Yw`yne`Yd `ww`Wh`wi`Wt`we `wC`Wo`wb`Wr`wa`^. Every single member of the 
army is ordered and cajolled by dark knights in ethereal black armor, all of 
which bear the same symbol as the flags.

2036 white marble statue zana~
A marble statue of a young, half-elven woman stands here on a platform.  She 
appears thin, with a lightly muscled frame, with skin that looks rather soft 
and smooth, without a blemish.  Her hair looks as though it falls down in 
silken waves about her shoulders, ending about halfway down her back.  Small 
pointed ears peek up from under the mass of what would be silver hair.  Her 
eyes are the only colored feature on this marble statue, which look like a 
sapphire blue.  Despite her athletic build, she shows soft curves that belie 
her human heritage.  The woman is squatting, leaning forward to pat the 
belly of a small wolf pup, who is rolling on its back.  A small smile is set 
in stone on this womans face as she looks down lovingly at the wolf. 
 
`#`sZana, a very loving woman.  Also loved by many.`^

Glancing at these shackles, they appear very thick and harsh. Strong enough

Realm of Ixliam~
~
Flames leap up from huge chunks of basalt rock that make up this landscape 
of nightmares.  Violent screams of pain can be heard in the distance, 
bringing visions of unending torment to your mind.  The ground and floor of 
this realm are made of the skulls and bones of the damned, all leading 
towards the large throne made of skulls sitting here.

`sA pretty stuffed room.  The walls are colored `mpurple`s and `Sblack`s with a `Mpink`s 
boarder on both the ceiling and floors.  There's a long oak desk that sits 
in the enter of the room, covered messily with papers.  Against one of the 
black walls, there is a `Mbright pink couch`s.  The furthest wall appears to be 
a blackboard with colorful, poorly written words that read: `M TO DO LIST:`m

This office is decorated with brilliant blue hues and clean whites. The
