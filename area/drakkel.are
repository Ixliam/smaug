His dark green robes flow to the floor like a waterfall in slow motion. His
beard is long and white mounted by a long white mustache. A pair of wire-rim
spectacles sit atop the bridge of his nose. His skin is a pale white color
and his hair is silver and falls over his shoulders neatly.

The history of Drakkel Sharda and the Angeriks:
 
the Angeriks were the human race that worshipped the dragon god Lokatar. He
was the god of all things slaughter and death. He ruled with an iron claw.
His people were murderous and hatefull, never caring for anything but them-
selves. They were exiled from all of their normal cities for their acts. Such
as Paleon, and many other cities. So they took to the cliffs and began work
on what is now Drakkel Sharda. Most of these humans were wiped out when the
good dragons came and wiped the city out. Now, the city is calm once again.
but there is still one dragon which holds a tie to the Angerik god...his
name is Ageld. If he dies, then the god will be released into the heavens
again to rule with his hate and bloodthirsty religion. He lies in his den,
deep within Drakkel Sharda, waiting for someone to come by and wake the
ancient one.

The Valley of Serus Maru~
~
The sand is a glistening white as a thick fog stays low and close to the
ground. A single tree with leaves of a palm stands here, barely shading the
area. A worn path looks to lead north, standing out as a printed trail by
footprints, scuffs and a few large gouges cutting deeply into the ground.

A Worn Path~
~
The white sand here has been scuffed aside and hard packed sand has taken
its place. Deep scratches have been made into the ground and continue north
and south here. The fog is still thick and close to the ground, but is still
light enough to see through. A rockface seems to rise up to the north, a
large split leading into the mass of solid stone. The heat is intense here.

A tall rockface stands here, towering into the sky. A thick mist seems to
come from the north where a large split leads into the large cliffbottom.
The ground here is hardpacked sand and has many deep scrathes going every
direction. A gust of wind blows slowly from the opening, making it temperate
here. The rock is made of a pure black quarts, veins of purple and red run
through it. The hall formed by the split leads north and into the large rock.

The tunnel is bright with many slightly glowing veins of red and pruple
that pulsate somewhat. The tunnel exit is just ahead but it is too dark
to tell exactly where or what it leads to from here. Swirling mist is thick
near the ground and has a slight glow of its own as well. The smell of wet
and new growth is in the air, which stands remarkably still with a cool
temperature. An eerie silence fills this hall here, as if something were
causing everything to stop its actions in fear.

A small pool with crystal blue water puts forth a pale light with sparkling
water. Large crystals of blue and red jut out of the ground and glow slightly
as well. A mist is slight and seems to roll in from the tunnel to the south.
A tunnel entrance can be seen to the east and west.

mist swirls around staying close to the tunnel floor. The tunnel opens into
a very large cavern to the north. However, a gate seems to be guarding the

The gates of the ancient Dragon city Drakkel Sharda stand here, withstanding
the tests of time, although the gates themselves were torn from their hinges,
the archway and path still remain the same as they did so many years ago. Large
braziers burn brightly with an ancient flame never dying. The path is lined
with many crystals that sparkle in the dim luminance. Directly to the north
lies the great city of Drakkel Sharda.

The tunnel here comes to an end as rocks and large blocks of broken crystal
lie in the path. This tunnel looks to be once used, but no more. Vines and
moss grow over most of the stone here as a very small stream seems to trickle
into the closed off area down the wall. The air is still and old, the smell of
moss is very overpowering yet doesn't seem to stink, it is just very strong
and smells of earth, water and fungi.

thousands of years worth of use. Large white crystals jut up from the ground

Lord Nycta's Lair~
~
The air is very cold here and seems not to move at all. To the east is the
mouth of a tunnel made completely from ice, glowing brightly. To the west,
the center of the Lair, as well as a large glacier that has been frozen solid
to the ground. To the north and south lie a pair of frozen over corners. This
place has a very unwelcome feeling to it.

Lord Nycta's Lair~
~
The corner here is completely encased in ice. Its deep blue glows putting
forth a bright light. The cut of the ice sparkles in it's own light. Some moss
has been trapped inside for what looks to be centuries, its tiny leaves
crystalized almost completely. The air is still and freezing here. The wall
here continues east, to the south is the mouth of an ice and moss covered
tunnel. The ground is made of stone which is also completely iced over.
To the southeast, the middle front part of the chamber stands open.

Lord Nycta's Lair~
~
The wall here is iced over completely. Some of the veins running through the
wall have also frozen and split it severely. Crystalized moss stands timeless
and puts forth its ever illuminating glow. The ground is uneven and slippery
due to the ice. The air is damagingly cold and still. Any smell that was once
here has been nullified by the frozen shadows of ice that now take the place
of objects that are no longer recognizeable. To the west, a frozen corner,
to the east another corner much like the one to the west. Southward lies the
dead center of the Lair.

The corner here is frozen solid and cracked with ice. The stone that once
was so great, has lost all of its' integrity. A hole in the floor here has

tunnel of complete ice. To the west, the wall tward another tunnel, covered
in moss, southwest lies the dead center.

The corner here is iced over completely. Underneath the ice is a large amount
of moss. The small leaves of this moss are crystalized and died a permanent
icy blue color. The ice produces a bright glow, yet chills the air greatly.
To the east the wall of this Lair continues, and to the north, the mouth of
a mossy tunnel. To the northeast, the center, with a large glacier affixed
to the ground.

Lord Nycta's Lair~

The stone here has been eaten away and replaced with the blue ice. The floor
is no longer the rough rock, but slick blue ice. No air moves here, everything
seems stagnant, even time itself. The ceiling is resident to sharp icicles
which appear to have not moved for some time, let alone been disturbed. To
the north a large slab of ice is frozen to the ground, glowing brightly. To
the east and west, the corners of the Lair.

Lord Nycta's Lair~
~
The corner here is made completely of ice, the stone that was once there has
been frozen so long, it has transformed into ice itself. The ground is ice as
well, with no sign that it was ever stone. The air is cold and stale. An
eerie feeling lingers about here. The ceiling is home to many jagged icicles.
To the north, the mouth of an ice tunnel can be seen, to the west, the further
wall of the Lair. Northwest lies the center of the Lair with a large chunk of
ice permanently affixed to the ground.

bones are scattered about. A large, heavy looking headstone lies here and
has a crack running through its center. It says something, but the words

A Short Tunnel~
~
This tunnel is heavily laced with cobwebs that have been here for many
centuries. They are frail and white, swaying gently as a draft touches
then with its soft fingers. To the north a chamber can be seen opening
up. To the south, a boneyard from years past. Many dead vines and patches
of moss line the walls here. They were once living, but now rest quietly
on the stone wall of this tunnel.

The floor here is made of a pure black stone. It has been masoned well and
is very even. A few cracks run through it, other than that it is near perfect.
to the north, a small set of steps lead to a platform. To the south, a cobweb
covered tunnel can be seen. to the east and west lie the corners of this
chamber. A few small crystals are at the opening of the tunnel putting forth
a soft white glow, lighting the area here.

A Crystalline Tunnel~
~
The tunnel here is grown over with moss and crystals. The moss stop about
halfway through the tunnel and meets crystals with a red coloring. A few
of the crystals glow putting forth a red light thats glances off the other
crystals. The tunnel here is dyed with red and is very beautiful. To the west
this tunnel continues. To the east lies an intersection of tunnels.

thousands of crystals of various colors that give off the light to the north.
The ground is of black sand and is uneven. The walls are made out of smooth
stone. A fresh pool of blood and marks where something large has been dragged
away lead to the north cavern.

Caillagh's Lair~
~
The walls of this cave appear to be ice, or perhaps coated in ice, but 
they glisten. The cave is lit by crystals, which give off an eerie glow. 
High above, the domed ceiling recedes almost out of view. The floor, made 
of cracked stone flags, shows considerable wear, as though a very large 
creature has passed over it many, many times.

&BThe first thing that catches your eye is the amazingly high ceiling to 
this cave. The exact height is hard to measure but four foot long 
stalactites hang down, giving rise to equally large stalagmites on the 
floor. This is a dark and foreboding room, the near total lack of light 
combined with the skittering feet of tiny creatures and the steady drip of 
water makes your skin crawl. In the center of this room is a large pile of 
gold coins and artefacts, precious stones and gems, and various other 
random items of treasure. It's obvious that the owner of this pile has 
taken great care in how every item is placed.

constructed from smooth, perfectly polished bricks of black obsidian. The 
mortar between the bricks is made of pure, molten gold. An eerie silence 
only further adds to the mystery of this place. This secret sanctuary is a 
refreshingly peaceful place and a sense of oneness with the Creator cannot 
be helped but be felt.

golden dragon statue stands guard. Along the walls to either side of the 
throne are ornately carved oak tables with silk table cloths, and a few 
delicately crafted gold candles atop. In each corner lies a tremendous 
mound of gold, trinkets, armor and treasure in general. It would be 
foolish for someone to steal from here.

blue shine out in the smoothly carved granite. There is a magical blue 
fire burning in a corner, emanating a gentle warmth. In another corner is 
a pile of furs, which appear to be the nest where Valakas sleeps. There is 
a pile of treasure in another corner. Clearly Valakas is partial to gold, 
and also to shiny blue objects, regardless of worth. If it sparkles, and 
if it is blue, it clearly attracts this dragon.

The walls are beaded with moisture, and chill pools collect here and there. A scattering of large, snapped bones, shed cobalt scale, and a distinct reptilian musk mark this as the lair of something not to be trifled with.

least one hundred feet high and as wide as five full-grown dragons. The 
rocks have been formed into what looks to be something of a chaotic 
nature. Stalagmites and stalactites jet out of the ground frivolously 
within the lair, each retaining jagged edges and razor sharp tips. Within 
the lair itself, lanterns have been placed high as well as lit torches 
lining the back wall. The foyer is well-lit, able to see the large stack 
of hay and different chests that adorn the floor to the eastern most 
potion of the wall. A mirror has been placed towards the western wall, as 
well as various paintings of dragons killing and mutilating different 
races through various means.

The very back of the cavern is lit by a faint glow. The light pours forth from the vast treasure that lays beyond. There is a wide shelf of metallic stone that glitters the brightest- this must be the resting place of the dragon who lives in this fabulous place.

of snow blow through the barren structure, swirling out into the black sky.
Ice sculptures stand erect throughout the lair, depicting various mortal
nobles and warriors... and upon closer inspection appear to be much to
life-like. In the center of the cave is a very large basin of water.
Despite the frigid temperatures, the water never freezes.

Sarkai's Lair~
~
&zThe entry of this vast cavern of utter darkness is a gaping hole in the 
sheer side of an obsidian volcanic mountain. The walls of this place 
swallow all light, and the darkness here seems stifling and impenetrable. 
Even the lights of torches and lanterns are engulfed, and there is a chill 
in the air that seems unnatural. All about is the stench of death, and the 
screams and cries of the dying and imprisoned seem to echo from the 
darkness, only to vanish as if never there. Vast jagged stallagtites and 
stallagmites bridge the floor to the unseen ceiling high above, as they 
disappear into the darkness overhead. A great crater in the floor is the 
one source of some light in the lair, as it is filled with a mound of 
untold quantities of gold, precious gems, armor, swords, and magical 
items. These items glitter in the darkness, like a flame before a moth. 
There is a great depression in the center of this pile of treasure, as if 
some huge weight was placed there at times. A crunching and scattering of 
things on the ground as it is traversed are the evidence of gnawed and 
broken bones that litter every inch of the floor. The bones of virtually 
every being are present: human, celestial, elf, demon, and even the great 
bones of dragons. Upon the smooth obsidian walls are great, ragged rends 
into the stone. Closer observation will show that they resemble horrid 
claw marks, as if a beast were marking its territory.

and there as well as sticking out of the wall. A pile of bones is stacked 
almost neatly against the entrance as heat wavers off of the newest patch 
of burnt ground akin to a tendril like mist that wavers just above the 
ground.

&zThis cave obviously belongs to a dragon, given where it originates from, 
and yet there is something about it that seems, for wont of a better term, 
alien. Where other dragons would have hoards of gold and jewels, this 
strange place seems to possess above all else corpses, twisted and broken 
bodies in various stages of decay strewn about in large piles close to the 
walls. The black stone of the cave is broken only by glowing purple glyphs 
inscribed at seemingly random points, their origins ancient and arcane 
which they exude in their mysterious pulsing light.

enough for a huge dragon to walk through comfortably. Water drips from the 
ceiling onto the floor, which is completely covered in freezing cold water. The 
air inside this cavern is so cold that a warm breath creates a fog.
