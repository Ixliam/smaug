Frosty Field~
~
The entire field is frozen solid in what looks to be fierce blizzard. The 
wind whips the snow around as if alive and the only thing in sight is a 
tall red and white striped pole with a sign with the words "North Pole" 
carved on it to the north.

A Cave Entrance~
~
The wind cuts off slightly as it encounters this recessed and hidden cave 
entrance. The sound it makes going into the cave is a high pitched keening 
sound that doesn't carry very far. Snow is piled up around the hole with 
barely any space left for an entry way.

The force of the wind dies down inside the cave, but the sound changes to

Between Two Snow Drifts~

The ground is full of hoofprints and small footprints passing from between 
and the two snow piles against the outer shell. The wind makes a slight 
whistling noise as it passes the front of this opening. Snow from the top 
of the piles drifts down every couple of seconds as the wind passes by.

Near Santa's Workshop~
~
A small path leads away from the workshop and between it and another 
building. It branches off leading to the doors of what looks to be a barn 
or stable of some kind. The foot prints continue in all directions, but 
the hoof prints only go up to the door of the other building.

off to the north but of a smaller size more suited to children and elves.

Infront of Santa's Room~

The large set of stairs leaves off infront of a giant set of red doors 
gilded with gold designs reminiscent of snow and happiness. Green trimming 
goes around the outside and the handles are two small snowglobes. The 
railing along the stairs is also gilded in gold.

Santa's Room~
~
The room is quite spacious with three large bay windows facing outwards 
behind the desk. The corners of each window is frosted over from the 
outside but most of each window is quite clear. The desk is full of 
clutter and rolls of parchment and the large green and gold gilded chair 
is slightly pushed back from the desk. On the wall is a golden plaque with 
the words Permanent Naughty List etched into it.
