At a Wide Path~
~
A wildly cut pathway provides more then enough clearance to carry anything 
one might need to take with them through this dense forest. To the north a 
lot of trees lay on their sides littering the western side of the path, 
preventing anyone from being able to enter the forest in the direction. 
off to the east, west and northwest stand extremely large trees, some have 
trunks that can be measured at nearly twelve foot around.

Starting up a Wide Path~
~
Along the path the large trees in the thick forest are wrapped in vines
and stretch toward the heavens.  It is nearly immpossible to know what is
on the other side of the wide trail due to the amount of trees and brush
that surround the wide path, that travels off to the north and southwest.

On a Path~
~
The dense forest here grows much thicker with large trees and heavy piles of
brush.  The small ruts in the pathway harbor alot of fresh rain water making
it a safe source for drinking.  To the south some fallen petrified trees are
on the edge of one side of the pathway.  A wide trail leads off to the north
and to the south.

A Turn in the Path~
~
The dense forest grows even thicker with trees and loose brush here, forcing
the pathway to turn toward the northeast up a small slope.  Ruts that can be
found on and along the sides of the trail have gotten much worse making it a
hard task to travel through at a fast pace.  The rough pathway also leads off
to the south toward some more smaller water filled ruts.

A Rutted Path~
~
The small puddles of stagnated water have been caused by the deep ruts 
that have been dug into the ground due to all of the traveling on the 
path. Large blades of wild growing grass, ferns, and other simple forms of 
vegetation can be seen somewhat to the northeast. To the southwest lay 
more rutted pathway.

A Split in the Path~
~
The hardend and rutted out path now softens to almost mud due to the swamps to
to the north, that has ferns and other forms of vegetation growing wildly about
the entire area.  Thick clouds of smoke cover the forest here lingering in from
the campsite to the northwest.  The wide path continues travel to the northeast
toward another trail that has been cut out along the eastern side of this path
leading deep into the dense forest to the east, and southwest toward a rutted
out rough pathway.

seen feeding off of the large amount of vegetation that is growing out of
the shallow murky swamps.  Blades of wild grass and ferns are growing thick
along the banks of the swamp.  A thick cloud of smoke lingers in from the

is a collection of beautiful white roses, the blooming roses harken back to
the many-petaled full flowers, fragrance, and soft colors reminiscent of the
roses.  Climbing and rambling roses grow on the arbors to the east and west

Before a Cathedral~
~
The large stone cathedral to the north is a supreme achievement of art, true
to the vision of the Creator.  Successive generations have embellished the
great building with decorations of the highest quality.  This great house of
the creator reflects the highest aspirations of humanity, and raises the mind
toward the glories of the heavens.  A fountain can be seen to the southwest
marking the center of the massive octagon shaped courtyard.  To the west one
of the few exits leading out of the courtyard can be found.

The Nave~

The massive main body of the cathedral consists of rows upon rows of 
wooden pews running towards an elegant baldacchino. Suspended between the 
sanctuary and the nave is the great rood. It seems to float in the dark 
spaces above the cavernous arches that soar upwards. All the lines of 
perspective focus on the baldacchino, and the high altar that is beneath 
it to the north. The narthex of the cathedral can be found to the south. 
To the northwest a small bapistry has been built into a little chamber. A 
passageway to the northeast leads beside the large sanctuary before 
entering into a wide hallway.

in the walls surrounding the marble baptismal font.  These montages depict very
significant events in the history of the creator.  In accordance with dwarven
practice the baptismal font is railed off and has a gate fastened by a lock.

At certain times of the day, particularly in the spring and autumn, the 
sun streams through the multi colored window panes of the stone cathedral 
shining brightly on the high altar. In doing so it illuminates the glass 
beads around the central crucifix, giving an aura of light. A few candles 
line the sides of the altar, each of them adorned with a pair of 
pear-shaped white opals set in pendants. The naves massive vaulted dome 
ceilings can be seen to the south. A cathedra made of ivory sits on top of

Backside of the Barrack~
~
In the far end of the room, more dust covered cots fill the area, along
with alot of garbage that has been scattered about the floor and on the
stands that sit beside the cots making for a awful mess.  A window on
the eastern wall gives off a view of a small lawn that sits in between
this barrack, and Manoake's stone library that can be seen to the east.
Somewhat to the north a doorway leads back out onto Thalimon Street.

Training Academy~
~
Many neat charismatic trinkets and awards can be found sitting around this 
little academy. The trinkets range from small statues, to useless ancient 
weapons, and suits of armor. Hanging along the walls are many plaques that 
show off all of the trainers awards. A sturdy wooden staircase with iron 
handrails is in the back of the room, leading up into the small loft that 
is above the training academy. To the south a wooden door leads back out 
onto Devinity Avenue.

Floating in a void~
~
Alot of differnt families of monocotyledonous type plants grow here forming
a wall of razor sharp blades of grass, preventing travel in almost all
directions but to the southwest.  The dead end of the path just how hard
this maze actally is.

Near a Green Pond~
~
&GA foul stench comes from the fungus infested green colored pond causing it
to attract many differnt types of small bugs and insects.  A light forest
surrounds the muddy banks of the pond, although a small down hill path can
be seen leading right into it to the east.  A trail leads back off to the
west through the light leading toward a roadway with columns running along
each side of it.

Near A Tunnel~

A very large boulder rest along the southern side of the pathway shaped
in a perfect sphere, and has oddly been placed firmly against the base of
a small tunnel that leads underground.  Two torches have been mounted on
each side of the boulder, sending out a dim blue glow.  At the edges of
the dense forest to the west is a small trail leading back into the dense
forest, and to the east sits a large campsite filled with small stumps and
a warm fire making for a good spot to sit and rest.

In a Green Pond~
~
&GStanding almost knee high in the shallow green water with fungus, and other
types of weird vegeation floating around, isnt fun by any means.  One can
barely stand the fumes that is admitted from the shallow pond.  The insects
and bugs are real bad here making it hard to travel though this part of the
green pond.  A muddy bank to the west leads back up onto the trail.

Out on a Limb~
Not Assigned~
From up inside the shade tree, the scenes from the palace courtyard
can be seen below. The chattering and plucking have grown to an unbearable
volume. A large nest made of mud and twigs rests on the end of the branch.
A collection of various trinkets is scattered throughout the nest. The raven
which calls this tree home rests within the nest.
