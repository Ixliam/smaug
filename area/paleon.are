stable master Jonah man~
Stable Master Jonah~
A tall old man is standing in the stables here.
~
Tall and lean, Jonah wears an amiable smile along with his torn and 
stained apron, in which he has tucked various stable tools. His green eyes 
seem crafty and bright, giving his wrinkled face a more youthful 
appearance. Streaked with white, his brown hair is cut short, with some 
rough bangs falling across his forehead.

Tavern Keeper Malachi~
A stout human male is very busy behind the bar.
~
Of middle age and average height, Malachi has a rough air about him and a pair of surly grey eyes. Lean with wiry muscles, his build seems more fit for an adventurer than a barkeep. His black hair is tied back in a low ponytail. On his left shoulder, a osprey tattoo is barely revealed by the short sleeve of his shirt.

guard gate Marak east~
Gate Guard Marak~
A gate guard dressed in full plate mail armor stands here.
~
Wearing the traditional garb of Paleon guards, Marak stands here with his 
blue eyes glazed over in boredom, tapping his spear idly against the 
ground. His uniform consists of a heavy jacket with shoulder pauldrons 
connecting to a thick cloak, a helm with a visor, and greaves over their 
thick pants. The whole outfit is gold and white, with the emblem of Paleon 
inscribed into their armor pieces.

A man clad in black studded leather armor stands here.

Standing at an intimidating 6'2, Symon is of impressive build and size. 
His fire red hair has been pulled back into a tight ponytail and tucked 
under a heavy black helm. From under the helm's sharp visor, his dark eyes 
peer around with a seasoned fighter's alertness. The rest of his muscular 
body is decked in studded black armor of well-crafted leather.

Shop Keeper Amelia~
An elderly human woman is standing here.
~
Constantly checking and polishing her potion vials and bottles, Amelia 
looks busy but cheerful. Her white hair, braided loosely and tied with a 
ribbon, hangs over her shoulder and down to her waist. Slightly hooded, 
her peaceful blue eyes have a patient look to them. Her thin form wrapped 
in the many folds of a cheerful yellow shawl, Amelia wears a peach-hued 
dress reaching her ankles.

Banker Joram~
A tall male human richly attired is standing here.
~
Dressed in a fine violet jacket with golden embroidery and well tailored 
black slacks, Joram looks to be affluent and posh. His blonde hair seems 
to be going grey at the roots, but his face is free of deep wrinkles. 
Calculating green eyes are sharp and alert, though can easily turn 
comforting and sympathetic when he is with a valued patron.

16005 ring hardiness~
This ring is a polished steel band with cobalt glass set into hollowed designs within the band. The designs form stylised waves rolling through the ring, which seem impervious to scratches and dents. Small sapphires set into the steel are of a pale cerulean hue, scattered about the wave designs almost like ocean spray. The metal is surprisingly warm to the touch and rests comfortably against the skin.

&W
The proprietor of the new Owl's Roost Tavern apologizes for any 
inconvenience arrising from our frantic construction efforts, but, 
submitting to the pressures of popular demand he has decided to open the 
establishment for your entertainment and refreshment even as it is 
continuing to be built, renovated, and decorated. 

All involved hope that you enjoy your visit here even through the 
construction phase of the tavern. Features to be added include a minstrel 
and private room rentals including fast recovery beds and other 
conveniences and entertainments. 

Thanks go out to Ilyessa, Samael, Ashugar and Infamous for suggestions and 
ideas regarding what would be interesting to include in this Tavern.

The gambling games in this Casino were designed and programmed by Greetmir 
who gratefully ackowledges and thanks a long lost friend, Delphir who not 
only contributed the skeleton of the programs for the Magic Spinning 
Wheels and the Coin Flip Parlor, but also contributed ideas for the 
Lottery Ticket Puller. Profuse thanks go out to him, wherever he is and 
also to the players here that so happily were guinea pigs during the 
testing phase. All contributions we greatly appreciated.

You must GIVE 10 GOLD REIVER to begin playing in the Coin Flip Parlor. He

double. The prize pot will grow exponentially doubling each time you make 
a correct guess as to the outcome of the flip up to a &WJackpot&w of 
&Y1,280 gold &wcoins if you should guess the outcome of the flip eight 
times in succession. Remember you may SAY STOP at any time and collect.
