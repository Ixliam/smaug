Eltoran Pixie Lord~
Eltoran, Lord of the Cliffs of Green~
A Pixie male with a commanding presence stands here proudly.
~
This Pixie man has a noble visage and a proud demeanor. Silver wings 
tipped in royal purple are furled against his back. He is the Lord of 
the Cliffs of Green, and his manner shows this clearly. A silver crown 
rests firmly upon his head. He gazes at the world from piercing black 
eyes, and his lips are curved in a gentle smile.

grass provides a velvet soft carpet.  The sound of waves crashing 
against the cliff mutes the cries of the birds flying above.  A crisp 
breeze scented by the lake tickles the grass.

Atop the Cliffs~

The carpet of grass ends abruptly at the cliff's edge.  A small 
path can be discerned leading down the side of the cliff.  Birds 
cry overhead in the breeze.  A small pile of rocks is stacked 
near the path's beginning.

A Narrow Trail along the Cliff~
~
A precariously steep and narrow trail leads down the cliff's face.  
The trail seems to be rarely used, and is covered in small pebbles 
which make the footing hazardous.  Small but tenacious flowers grow 
defiantly along the edges of the trail.  The wind whips violently. 
The crashing sound of the lake warns of the fate of any who slip 
from the path.

Scattered pebbles litter the trail, making footing hazardous.  Tiny 
flowers line the edge of the trail in defiance of the dangers.  A salt
scented wind pushes threateningly, as if determined to push travelers

A Narrow Trail along the Cliff~

Although the path here is less steep, it appears no less dangerous. 
The trail curves gently as it winds down the cliff face.  The sounds

path once led to the northeast but has been washed out by an avalanche.

the lower it goes.  Soft green grass is once more making an appearance.

The path levels off, leading onto a level terrace that fronts a large 
niche carved into the cliff face.  Abundant green grass marks a vivid 
contrast to the grey of the cliff and the blue of the lake below. 
A few scattered pebbles still provide danger to those traversing the 
path on foot.  The stiff breeze provides its own dangers for those 
who would attempt to fly here.

Scaling the Cliff~
~
The path here is almost vertical, and practically non-existent. A few 
small niches carved into the cliff are intended to provide hand holds to 
make travel somewhat safer. Birds fly by, taunting in their effortless 
flight. A large bush covers some type of opening here.

Scaling the Cliff~
~
The steep path ends in a narrow ledge barely above the water at high 
tide.  To the east the lake surges like a restless animal.  The cliff 
towers high over the ledge.  The surrounding terraces are not visible 
from this perspective.

In the Lake~
~
Waves crash against the nearby cliff.  The salt water is deep blue, 
and turbulent.  Vicious undertows threaten the unwary swimmer. To 
the west the cliff face rises in all its splendor.  The terraces can 
be clearly seen, looking almost like a giant's meandering staircase.

In the Lake~
~
Deep blue water roils turbulently.  White crested waves slap angrily 
at the base of the cliff.  The terraced cliff rises defiantly over 
the lake to the west.  Scattered movement indicates the presence of 
creatures living on the terraces.
