anita blake~
`#`wAnita`^~
`#`w"`RThe Executioner`w" Anita Blake is here raising the dead.`^
~
Her hair is black and curls just above the shoulders. The solid nearly 
black-brown of her eyes matches her hair. Her skin is very pale. She has 
multiple scars. The worst scars are on the bend of her left arm. She also 
has two cross-shaped burn marks. One on her arm and another on her chest.

jean claude~
`#`wJean Claude`^~
`#`sJean Claude `wstands here in his `Wwhite frilly `wshirt.`^
~
He moves like a dancer, or a cat, a smooth, gliding walk. Energy and grace 
contained, waiting to explode into violence. He's not that tall, maybe 
five-eleven. His hair is perfectly black, curling softly around his face. 
His eyes, if you dare to look into them, are a blue so dark they are almost 
black. Like glittering, dark jewels. The only thing that mars the perfection 
of his body is a dark cross-shaped scar on his chest. If you could bottle 
Jean-Claude's laugh it would be fattening. Or orgasmic.

`#`wDead Dave`^~
`#`sDead Dave `wis here wiping down a counter.`^
~
Dead Dave is tall, wide, with short brown hair that had been balding when he 
died. He's lost no more hair but it hasn't grown back either.

`#`wJason`^~
`#`sJason `wis here, taking one for the team.`^
~
Jason has thin blond hair cut just above his shoulders, no bangs. His eyes 
are the same pale blue as the sky. He is exactly Anita's height, five three, 
which makes him short, especially for a man.

asher~
`#`wAsher`^~
`#`sAsher `wstands here looking regal.`^
~
Asher is a blue-eyed blond, but that description doesn't do him justice. 
The waves of his shoulder-length hair is golden. Not blond, but gold. His 
hair is almost metallic in its glittering brilliance. He eyes are a blue so 
pale, they are almost white, like the eyes of a husky. Half of Asher's face 
is the beauty that drew a master vampire to him centuries ago. The other 
half is covered in scars. Holy water scars. The scars start about an inch 
from the midline of his face so his eyes, nose, and those full, perfect lips 
remained untouched, but the rest was like melted wax.

nathaniel~
`#`wNathaniel`^~
`#`wNathaniel is here dressed in head to toe `sleather.`^
~
Nathaniel has long auburn hair that hangs like a shining curtain around his 
face, maybe longer than waist-length. His eyes are the color of lilacs, a 
wonderful pale lavender that is a genuine show-stopper. Nathaniel manages to 
be childlike, catlike, and still be an adult. You don't know whether to pat 
him on the head, rub his belly, or kiss him.

`#`wMalcolm`^~
`#`sMalcolm`W, the leader of the church is here. `^
~
Malcolm is tall and almost painfully thin, with large bony hands that 
belonged to a more muscular man. His short, curly hair is the shocking 
yellow of goldfinch feathers.

richard zeeman~
`#`wRichard`^~
`#`sRichard `wis here sitting at a table.`^
~
He has high-sculpted cheekbones and a firm jaw. A dimple softens the lines 
of his face. He shows signs of weightlifting, just enough, not too much. His 
smile is very bright against his permanently tanned skin. His long brown 
hair falls in a wavy mass around his shoulders. In sunlight it gleams with 
strands of gold, hints of copper. His eyes are brown and very human. Most of 
the time!

Narcissus is about five foot seven and wears makeup on his pale triangular 
face. His black hair is cut very short, though you can tell it would be 
curly if it was worn long. He likes to cross-dress.

Kissa is tall, taller than Jean-Claude. Her skin is the color of coffee with 
two creams. Her dark hair falls in long cornrows to her waist. Her 
high-boned face is empty of makeup, and still she is beautiful.

~
Magnus Bouvier's hair falls to his waist like thick, chestnut-colored water. 
He has startling blue-green eyes, like deep sea water. He is dark and lovely 
rather than handsome, androgynous as a cat. He is exotic as hell.

This area is dedicated to my favorite author Laurell K. Hamilton and her 
Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. It is in no way affilitated with her or 
her books and this area is not exactly something out of her books but only 
some places out of them that are important. Please read her books, they are 
good! Thanks, Delandria.

Beginning of a long dark street.~
~
Vampires call it "the District." Humans call it the Riverfront, or Blood 
Square, depending on if they're being rude or not. It's the town's hottest 
vampire commercial district and a big tourist attraction.

The Lunatic Cafe is owned by Raina and located in University City. Its sign 
is a glowing crescent moon with the restaurant name done in soft blue neon. 
There is a bar along one wall, polished dark wood, old and lovingly cared 
for. The rest of the room has small, round tables that could comfortably 
seat about four. Great place to meet lycanthropes.

Church of Eternal Life~
~
At the Church of Eternal Life they promise just what the name says, eternal 
life. And they can prove it. No leap of faith. No waiting around. No 
questions left unanswered. How does it feel to be dead? Just ask a fellow 
vampire church member! The Church is run by Master vampire Malcolm and 
located far from the District. The Church doesn't like to be associated with 
the riffraff. They think of themselves as mainstream undead. They recruit by 
going door to door, like the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses. A sign on 
the door reads, "Enter Friend and be at Peace."

Burnt Offerings~
~
Burnt Offerings is a bar and restaurant located far from the vampire 
district. The waiters are either real vamps or just wannabes. As you walk 
through the door there is a poster from 1970's movie Burnt Offerings. There 
is a life size waxwork of Christopher Lee as Dracula in the bar. There is 
one wall with framed caricatures of horror stars of the sixties and 
seventies. It isn't uncommon to see clusters of visitors trying to identify 
who is who. At midnight whoever has the most correct guesses gets a free 
dinner for two. Try the Bela Lugosi burger while you're there - extra rare 
unless otherwise requested!

Old Abandoned Hospital~
~
All vampire victims are taken to the basement of the old St. Louis City 
Hospital. The hospital was closed down but the morgue stayed open because 
they couldn't afford to move the vampire room. It's a special vault room 
with a steel reinforced everything and crosses laid on the outside of the 
door. There's even a feeding tank to take the edge off that first blood 
lust. Rats, rabbits, guinea pigs. Just a snack to calm the newly risen. 
 
There is a set of stairs leading down here.

The District~
~
The street is dimly lit by street lamps that barely work. There are trash 
cans lining the street but it seems that nobody uses them. There is old 
newspapers and trash crumbled at your feet. The whole district seemss 
strange to you.

The Leather Den~
~
The Leather Den has the honor of being the only bar in the country that is a 
hangout for sadomasochistic gay men who happen to be shapeshifters. Yikes.

Circus of the Damned~
~
The Circus of the Damned is housed in an old warehouse. Its name is emblazoned across the roof in colored lights. Giant clown figurines dance around the words. If you look very closely at the clowns, you notice they have fangs.
The sides of the building are strung with huge plastic banners. One banner shows a man being hung. Zombies crawl from a graveyard in another picture. A very bad drawing shows a man halfway between wolf and man shape. None of the banners look very wholesome.

Full Dark Beauty Salon~

The windows are blacked out, outlined in bloodred neon. You can get your 
hair and nails done by a vampire, if you want to.

The Tenderloin~
~
The Tenderloin was originally the red light district on the Riverfront in 
the 1800's. The night streets are neon-coated, sparking, flashing, 
pulsing--colors. It looks like some sort of pornographic carnival.

Old Abandoned Cemetery~
~
The area is flat and there are about a dozen very old graves here. The 
tombstones are crumbling as they age and all the grass has died long ago. 
There is a single oak tree in the middle of the graves. 
 
There is a large circle on the ground here. It looks like it is made with blood.

Bloody Bones Bar and Grill~
~
The bar has tall wooden ceilings and wooden floors. There is a fancy bar 
with stools in the rear of the bar. Several small tables are spread 
throughout and they are all full of whispering patrons. Bloody Bones? What a 
funny name for a bar.
