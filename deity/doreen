#DEITY
Filename       doreen~
Name           Dorenne~
Description    The principles of Dorenne's faith are simple. She holds three beliefs as 
key and ignores most of the rest of her followers doings if they do not fall 
within these simple ideas. 
Death with purpose`^  Let no death be wasted. Each death should have a 
purpose that is guided by need. Nature does not waste nor should those that 
follow her. Even your own death should have a purpose. Do not allow yourself 
to be struck without purpose. 
Civilization is a creation of man and should never step beyond that simple 
truth. Nature is of Dorenne and should be treated with the respect of any 
God's will. To destroy the work of a God for the work of man is foolish. 
Long after Civilization has fallen, Nature will still endure. Those that 
follow Dorenne should always be mindful of this and value things 
accordingly.
 Nature does not control and man should not either. If something was not 
meant to be in nature, it will not be. Any attempt by man to change this is 
wrong. Life is free to live as life wishes to. That is the Nature of Life.
