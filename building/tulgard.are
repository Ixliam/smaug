Common Room~

This common room is not as large as most, but then again the entire inn 
seems to be on the small side.  What it lacks in size, however, seems to be 
made up for in comfort.  There are padded chairs all around the tables, and 
all of the furnishings and decorations look quite expensive.  A finely 
polished wooden bar dominates the west wall, and a large brick fireplace is 
set in the east.  There is an exit back to the reception area to the north, 
and stairs leading up to the guest rooms.

being used once, before breaking.  This shop is obviously where people come 
to sell their unwanted belongings, but if you look close enough, you might 
find something useful.  There is a boldly painted sign hanging over the 
counter.

The Sunken Ship Tavern~
~
Rundown is definitely the word to use for this old place.  There are lots of 
tables and chairs around, but most are broken in some way, and quite dirty.  
A filthy wooden bar stands alongside the west wall, but there doesn't appear 
to be much to drink behind it.  Just a few old barrels, and seven swords in 
an odd shape, hanging from the wall. There are windows, but they are greasy 
and broken.  The exit to the street is south.

Small to medium sized boats are busily navigating the river. Some laborers
can be seen hauling cargo off the boats into small warehouses along the city 
wall which lines the north and west right up to the water's edge.  
Several boats can be seen anchored along the wharfs here.

River Road~
~
You are standing on the north edge of a wide river.  It flows from west to 
east, and is fairly calm at this point.  You can see the land on the other 
side, but not well enough to make out any details.  You hear drunken shouts 
coming from the tavern to the north, and you see many boats and canoes 
docked just to the south of here.

Main Street~
~
The street runs east and west here, and is one of the busier parts of the 
city.  Shops line the north and south edges, both here and to the east.  
There are large gates just to the west of here.  The two buildings to the 
north and south look especially interesting, and there are signs on both.  
Trees and bushes are growing at even intervals, and add a nice touch to the 
street.

Your vessel travels up northwards and you notice a deserted lighthouse at 
the edge of a cliff, along the coast to your west.  The lighthouse looks 
deserted.  After a while, the vessel changes course again and heads east.

A Dirty Office~
~
A small wooden desk sits in the northeastern corner of this office.  Papers 
and books litter the top of the wooden desk in an unkept fashion.  On the 
western wall of the office you see a large book shelf that has rows upon 
rows of books in all shapes and sizes.  The air is filled with the scent of 
leather and dust that lingers about.  A `#`Slarge sign`^ has been nailed to the 
northern wall of the office.

Yagro's Toy Store~

This small building is covered with shelves upon shelves of dolls, wooden 
toys, and other sorts of childish things.  At the end of the store you 
notice a small wooden counter covered with papers.  Everything seems to be 
neatly placed and the smell of fresh wood lingers in the air.

A Dusty Shop~
~
The air in this small, cramped room is extremely dusty. A large sweeping 
broom that rests in the corner is covered in a layer of dust that would make 
a cleaning servant scream and run for cover. Along the walls empty shelves 
are stacked to the ceiling. A small counter stands near the far wall, 
situated infront of a comfortable swivel chair.

A Quiet Room of Reflection~
~
There is an air of quiet in this small tidy room. A few bookcases, filled 
with tightly rolled scrolls have been placed against the walls. The walls 
have no ornamentation, and a single, thick candle stands at the centre of 
the room, bathing the room in a warm glow. Heavy curtains, drawn and held in 
place by a simple cord, frame the doorway that leads to the west.

A Dimly Lit Storeroom~

Several bulky crates are piled upon each other and litter this dimly lit 
room.  Layers of dust cover some, others seem to have been placed here more 
recently.  Some cobwebs add to the eery atmosphere in this cellar-like room. 
 A dark curtain, that fades in with the colour of the wall, is draped along 
the south wall.

The Thieves Union~
~
As new as the city is, it looks like a guild of thieves has already 
organized and set up shop here hidden from the streets. The room is far from 
fancy - all you see is some excercise mats and a few tables and chairs. 
Maybe there is more than meets the eye. To the north you see what looks like
a small storeroom filled with crates and boxes.

River Road~
~
You are standing on the north edge of a wide river.  It flows from west to 
east, and is fairly calm at this point.  You can see the land on the other 
side, but not well enough to make out any details.  South of here you can 
see the tips of what must be masts on small boats.

Foreign-Made Furniture~
~
Inside this rather cramped and cluttered shop, are displays of furniture, 
some of which are quite unusual, and others which are more common.  The 
pieces of furniture haven't been made locally, but have been shipped in from 
distant parts of the land.  There are elven-made dressers, gnomish 
contraptions, and pieces of furniture large enough for a troll.

Karrusmon's Custom Creations~
~
As you enter the doorway, the aroma of exotic pipeweeds fill your head with 
thier heavy scents.  There are about a dozen little beakers and bottles with 
some concoction or another boiling away in them, heated from some unseen 
magiks.  The interior of this shop is impecibly clean and organized.  There 
are many shelves behind the main desk which are very neatly lined with 
countless spell components, empty bottles, and blank sheets of paper.  
Hanging on the walls there are some weapons that emit strange vibrations 
into the air.

Large Plaza~
~
You are in the middle of a wide square plaza, with streets running in all 
directions.  Crushed grey stone has been spread around on the ground to 
cover the dirt.  In the middle of the square is a huge stone disk, upon 
which stands the statue of a regal looking dwarf.  There are some trees and 
bushes along the edges of the plaza.  Small shops line the streets in all 
directions, and you see and hear many people in those directions. A large 
set of stairs go up to the Hall of Rememberance from here.

You are along the north side of a mighty river that is flowing slowly from

here and there.  Off to the west you can see some small rafts, canoes, and 
boats bobbing up and down in the water.  You can go in that direction or 
follow the river east.  There is a bridge spanning the water, but it is 
rather flimsy looking.  You might be taking a chance crossing over to the 
south side.

Main Street~

The street runs east and west here, and is one of the busier parts of the
city.  Shops line the north and south edges, both here and to the east.
A wide plaza is just west.  The two buildings to the north and south look 
especially interesting, and there are signs on both.  Trees and bushes are
growing at even intervals, and add a nice touch to the street.

itself looks very strong, as do the walls surrounding it.  Streets lead

You are inside the home of the city's religious order.  Actually, now
that you have a chance to look around, it looks more like a gathering
place for priests of all types rather than any one religion.  There are
various artifacts hanging on the walls, and some comfortable furniture
is scattered around the room.  A simple marble altar is in the north end
of the room, along with some pads for kneeling on.

You are in a small uncrowded tavern.  The bar itself is along the east

There is even a nice stone fireplace on the north end, although there
is nothing burning at the moment.  Windows face the south and west,
giving a nice view of the surrounding streets.  The most interesting
feature of the room, however, has got to be the many shelves behind
the bar.  They are jammed full of dozens of bottles of all shapes, sizes
and color.  There are also a few casks stacked in the southeast corner.

This looks like the place where the local magi practice their art.  There

Stubs of candles are everywhere, along with scraps of various spell
components.  You even notice a few charred spots on the walls and floor
where experiments apparently didn't go quite as planned.  There even seems
to be a few things for sale here.

Tulgard Guard Headquarters~
~
You are apparently in the main headquarters for the organization that guards 
the town.  Everything is very official and military here, from the neatness 
of the papers on the desks to the rigid stance of the guards.  There is an 
exit east, and smaller offices to the west and south.  The Tulgard crest is 
emblazoned on just about everything in here.
