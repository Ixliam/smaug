seems to be on the small side.  What it lacks in size, however, seems to be 
made up for in comfort.  There are padded chairs all around the tables, and 
all of the furnishings and decorations look quite expensive.  A finely 
polished wooden bar dominates the west wall, and a large brick fireplace is 
set in the east.  There is an exit back to the reception area to the north,

to sell their unwanted belongings, but if you look close enough, you might 
find something useful.  There is a boldly painted sign hanging over the

The Sunken Ship Tavern~
Rundown is definitely the word to use for this old place.  There are lots of 
tables and chairs around, but most are broken in some way, and quite dirty.  
A filthy wooden bar stands alongside the west wall, but there doesn't appear 
to be much to drink behind it.  Just a few old barrels, and seven swords in 
an odd shape, hanging from the wall. There are windows, but they are greasy 
and broken.  The exit to the street is south.

Several boats can be seen anchored along the wharfs here.

River Road~
You are standing on the north edge of a wide river.  It flows from west to 
east, and is fairly calm at this point.  You can see the land on the other 
side, but not well enough to make out any details.  You hear drunken shouts 
coming from the tavern to the north, and you see many boats and canoes 
docked just to the south of here.

Maybe there is more than meets the eye. To the north you see what looks like

countless spell components, empty bottles, and blank sheets of paper.  
Hanging on the walls there are some weapons that emit strange vibrations

feature of the room, however, has got to be the many shelves behind
the bar.  They are jammed full of dozens of bottles of all shapes, sizes
